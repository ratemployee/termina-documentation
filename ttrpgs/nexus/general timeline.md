# [[general timeline]]

- once, there was a world, and the world was happy
- this world was home to myriad peoples, each with their own distinct culture and story—these people, each and every one, were capable of wielding magic, which aided them in their way of life
- it was understood by these people that the magic that they channelled came from within—however, the reserves of magic any living individual possessed paled in comparison to that within the planet itself
- so, as the people and their cultures grew and developed and the demands of their lifestyles necessitated the use of increasingly powerful magic, they began to draw upon the planet itself
- it took quite some time for the people of the world to realize that there was harm in doing so, and by the time that some of the most brilliant minds realized that the planet's reserves of magic, while vast, were not infinite, it was too late
- a great war took place, with the various kingdoms and cultures seeking to control the last wellsprings of magic that existed in the world. these conflicts, compounded with the ever-fading heartbeat of the planet, spelled her inevitable end—the last bit of magic harnessed, the planet died
- the people of the world continued to soldier on in spite of the state of the planet, discovering new and creative ways to survive in a world that grew increasingly inhospitable. with magic being inaccessible, many learned to utilize the resources available to them, growing increasingly innovative and brilliant
- the lives of these people were difficult, with horrible creatures known as the scourge descending from the stars to feast upon a world that could not defend itself, but small pockets of civilization managed to persist
- though the people of the myriad other planes that existed on the periphery of the material plane cared little for the affairs of their neighbours, it eventually became clear that, in some small way, the lives of these other planes depended on that of the plane at their heart. accordingly, and to stop their own planes from beginning the slow, inevitable march towards death, a collection of powerful witches chose to make a powerful sacrifice
- either unbeknownst to or in direct defiance of the wishes of the people of their respective planes, these witches utilized all of their power to bind their homes to the material plane, sundering themselves in the process—through their sacrifice and the degree of magic surrendered, these bindings became permanent
	- this event was known as the great convergence
- though there was, understandably, chaos resulting from the sudden converging of disparate places with disparate cultures, the ten witches—who, in their sacrifice, had ascended to godhood—spoke to their respective peoples, and snuffed the fires of war
- in the centuries since the great convergence, a tenuous peace has settled over the land. though the planet has not been fully revitalized, the presence of the other planes has suffused her with power, allowing her heart to beat with new life. further, the presence of the planes suffused the land with magic, allowing people to utilize it again.
- accordingly, magic, science, and faith all compound to create a culture disparate from those that might exist elsewhere in the multiverse—and while this peace might be temporary, it is present for now.
