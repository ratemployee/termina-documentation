# [[pantheon]] 

- "**[[the beast below]]**"
	- where water gods once were more personified and took on human forms, man's growing understanding (or lack thereof) of the things that lurk in the deep have changed this; the beast below is that: the embodiment of the concept that something colossal and horrible waits in the darkest depths of the ocean, waiting to usher unsuspecting sea travelers into its waiting grasp
- "**[[the beloved]]**"
	- it is human nature to crave companionship and love, and to find those that are meant to be in their lives; [[the beloved]] represents this concept--they take the form of everyone one ever has and ever will love; they smell like the sweetest ambrosia and emanate warmth and comfort. by the same token, [[the beloved]] can be cruel--they equally represent the earthshattering heartbreak of a love lost
- "**[[the body electric]]**"
	-  they are the storm, from the most gentle breeze to the most catastrophic hurricane; they are as likely to keep an aircraft aloft as they are to smash it to bits. a force of nature, and often depicted as such.
- "**[[the clockwork king]]**"
	- far and away one of the oldest, said to be the embodiment of time itself; does not view the passage of time as most would, instead said to see and experience all things that have and will ever be; more often feared than worshipped
- "**[[the conductor]]**"
	- the god of music and performance; often creative, playful, and inclined to associate with mortals more than their contemporaries. consummate performers, they thrive in places of the arts.
- "**[[the cultivator]]**"
	- the mother nature archetype; similar to the earthmother but of a lesser scale; not the creator of the earth but the tender of the things upon it; often viewed as warm and welcoming
- "**[[the drifter]]**"
	- often connected to [[the cultivator]]; represents those that walk in and amongst the natural world and have some measure of control over it; in some way exhibits mankind's desire to remain in touch with the natural world
- "**[[the earthmother]]**"
	- the mother earth archetype; not necessarily matronly, but often viewed as a feminine leader of sorts; likely one of the older gods
- "**[[the font]]**"
	- curiosity and wanderlust are natural things, and it is theorized that these once motivated [[the font]]; in the present, they represent omnipotence--they are said to know all things, though they do not provide this wisdom freely. this knowledge specifically is earned through study and determination, rather than some blessing or gift
- "**[[the last light]]**"
	- all know of the last light: the light at the end of the tunnel, which heralds the end of one's life. the last light is that concept personified: the being that rules over the underworld and welcomes (either happily or cruelly) those that have met their end into its halls. the last light is ultimately fairly impartial, and serves as a judge of the worth of a human's soul
- "**[[the reaper]]**"
	- if [[the last light]] is the ruler of the underworld and decides who enters its hall, [[the reaper]] is the ferryman that brings souls to them; the embodiment of death lurking at one's shoulder, many fear the reaper, knowing what its presence means. this is not to say that the reaper is cruel, however; while its presence means death is inevitable, they often are gentle (if stern) about their work
- "**[[the rising sun]]**"
	- of immense power, connected to the sun itself and thus (albeit distantly) human life; not necessarily older but often respected due to the amount of power and influence wielded
- "**[[the silver moon]]**"
	- also of considerable power but more ethereal and mysterious; connected to the night and thus less frequently looked upon/directly worshipped
- "**[[the skyfather]]**"
	- the powerful, often leaderly type; either the most powerful or the most respected; likely an older god
- "**[[the spark of life]]**"
	- often believed to be present when all living things are born, the spark of life is the cultivator of man; it heals, preserves, and protects, inasmuch as it can. very widely worshipped because of this.
- "**[[the strategist]]**"
	- though war is horrible, it has an undeniable place in the annals of history; the strategist represents each and every one of these conflicts. the god of war and battle, they equally represent the bloody, gruesome desperation and the cold, calculating wisdom; they are in the same breath the footsoldier desperate to return home and the commander contemplating over a map
- "**[[the trickster]]**"
	- the desire to manipulate, to deceive, to betray; not inherently evil but definitely self-serving; duplicitous and often deriving glee from the inconvenience and misfortune of others; sometimes playful, sometimes horribly cruel
- "**[[the visionary]]**"
	- man ever marches forward, seeking new knowledge and innovating, either out of idle curiosity or a desire to push mankind further into the future. [[the visionary]] is said to whisper in the ears of engineers, inventors, and creatives, urging them to push themselves further in pursuit of new discovery. cares less about people and more about creations.
- "**[[the wild hunt]]**"
	- beings like [[the earthmother]], [[the explorer]], [[the cultivator]] tend to nature, and are the carers of it; [[the wild hunt]] is born *of it*; it is present in every creature, every thing; it is the hunger that drives animals to desperation, and the bloodthirst that leads man to hunt animal in turn; it is neither kind nor conscious nor logical--it is raw instinct
- "**[[the wixen]]**"
	- the god of magic. has no place in the human world, and exclusively connected to and worshipped in liminal spaces. said to be the reason why the human and liminal worlds are kept separate--keeps them divided for their own protection. often works in tandem with [[the font]] but work in very different ways--far more vivacious and risk-taking than [[the font]]
