## Log

- was sent by my god, [io](app://obsidian.md/io), to warn the [— forged bond](app://obsidian.md/%E2%80%94%20forged%20bond) about the dracorage and the threat that it poses to the world
- arrived a day late, but found the party alive, albeit wounded and concerned
- offered my services to the party, opening up about the fact that i am not from this world
- found myself joining with the party in the [mithral mine](app://obsidian.md/mithral%20mine), in search of an amethyst dragon, hoping to retrieve a scale from the dragon for reasons that were not disclosed to me
- found the dragon, in possession of (and perhaps being controlled by) a dark crystal of some kind
- in the fray, the amethyst dragon was joined by a shadow dragon of some description

### combat — dragons

- i cast _forbiddance_ in preparation for the combat
- i managed to stick _synaptic static_ on both of the dragons, and [ale](app://obsidian.md/ale) trapped them in mud
- my friend, [cro](app://obsidian.md/cro), was frightened by the dragons
- another ally, [aingeal](app://obsidian.md/aingeal), was charmed by the dragons
