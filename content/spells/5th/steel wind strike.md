V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)

You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee weapon attack against each target using the weapon used in the casting. On a hit, targets take the normal damage of an attack with that weapon plus an additional 5d10 force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.
