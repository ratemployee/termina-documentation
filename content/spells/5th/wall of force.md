A shimmering opaque wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range and lasts for the duration.

_**Orientation & Shape.**_¬†The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or an angle. It can be free floating or rest on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome, a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. Nothing can pass through the wall physically, and anything viewed through it is lightly obscured. The wall extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. If it cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it chooses which side of the wall it moves to. On a failure, you choose the side it moves to.

_**Statistics.**_¬†The wall has 150 hit points and its Armor Class equals your Spell save DC. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a [[dispel magic]] spell, but a¬†[[disintegrate]]¬†spell destroys the wall it instantly.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the hit points of the wall created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 5th.
