When you hit with a melee weapon attack you can cause the weapon to crackle with pure arcane force. This attack deals 5d10 bonus force damage, and if it reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, it is banished from the current plane.

If the target is native to a different plant of existence than the one you are currently on, it disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to your current plane, it is banished to a harmless demiplane where it is incapacitated. When the spell ends, the target returns to the space it was banished from, or the nearest unoccupied space.

If the target is not native to your current plane of existence this bonus force damage increases by 1d10.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the bonus force damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5th.
