You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action (including the bonus action used to cast this spell) to make two attacks with a ranged weapon that uses ammunition from this quiver. When you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the ammunition you used with a nonmagical copy of that ammunition. Pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.
