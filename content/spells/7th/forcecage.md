A shimmering, immobile, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area of your choice within range. You choose whether this magic prison is shaped like a cage with bars or a solid box.

_**Shape.**_ If you choose cage, it can be up to 20 feet on a side and made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. If you choose box, it can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area. The cage extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

_**Creatures Inside.**_ When you cast the spell, any creatures that are completely inside the area of the cage are trapped. Any creatures partially within the area, or too large to fit are pushed away until they are completely outside of the cage.

A creature inside the cage cannot leave it by non-magical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. The spell or effect is wasted on a failed save, but on a success the creature uses the spell or effect to escape.

_**Statistics.**_ The cage's Armor Class equals your Spell save DC and it has 200 hit points. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a [[dispel magic]] spell, but a [[disintegrate]] spell destroys the cage it instantly.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th-level or higher, the hit points of the cage created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 7th.
