When you hit with a melee weapon attack you can cause the weapon to ignite with white-hot intensity. This attack deals 1d8 additional fire damage and the target bursts into flames. At the start of each of its turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 fire damage, but on a success, the flames are extinguished. Another creature can use an action to extinguish these magical flames.

If your target is a plant, both the initial fire damage and the fire damage dealt on a failed saving throw increase by 1d8.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, both the initial fire damage dealt by the attack and the fire damage dealt to the creature on a failed saving throw increase by 1d8 for each slot.
