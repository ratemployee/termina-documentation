A burst of elemental water erupts from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose, forcing any creature in that area to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 1d12 cold damage and is knocked back 10 feet in a straight line and falls prone. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not moved or knocked prone. A Huge or larger creature has advantage on its saving throw.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 and it knocks back 10 additional feet for each slot level above 1st.
