You hurl a bolt of pure spirit at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against your target. On hit, it takes 3d6 radiant damage and for the duration, its speed is reduced to 0 as it is pinned in place by the spiritual bolt. As an action on its turn, the creature can make a Strength ability check against your Spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
