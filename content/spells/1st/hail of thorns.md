When you hit a creature within range with a ranged weapon attack, you can cause the piece of ammunition to explode into a hail of thorns. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of your attack and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 piercing damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
