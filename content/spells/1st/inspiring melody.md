You play a tune that inspires those who hear it to stand and fight. Creatures of your choice within range that can hear you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum: 1 temporary hit point).

As a bonus action on each subsequent turn, you can use an instrument to play this tune again and grant another creature that can hear you within range these temporary hit points.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the range increases by 5 feet and you can grant one additional target temporary hit points each time you play, for each slot level above 1st.
