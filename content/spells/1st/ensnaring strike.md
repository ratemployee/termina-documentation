When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the point of impact to explode with a writhing mass of thorny vines. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the vines until the spell ends. Creatures that are Large or larger have advantage on this saving throw.

The restrained creature takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The restrained creature, or another creature within 5 feet, can use its action to make a Strength check against your Spell save DC, freeing it on a success.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the damage it takes at the start of each turn increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
