When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can cause the weapon to explode with a thunderous shockwave audible out to 300 feet. This attack deals 1d8 additional thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you in a line and fall prone. Huge and larger targets have advantage on this saving throw.

If your target is a construct or an earth elemental the bonus thunder damage increases by 1d8 and it has disadvantage on the Strength saving throw.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the thunder damage increases by 1d8, and the target is pushed an additional 10 feet away from you in a straight line for each spell slot level above 1st.
