When you hit with a melee weapon attack you can cause the weapon to strike at both body and mind. This attack deals an additional 1d8 psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can repeat this Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects of the spell on a success.

If your target is an aberration or it can speak telepathically this bonus psychic damage increases by 1d8.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1st.
