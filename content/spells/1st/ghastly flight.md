You release a malevolent spirit that flies out from you in a direction of your choice in a 60-foot long, 5-foot wide line, at which point it fades away. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 2d8 necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn. On a success, creatures take half as much damage and can regain hit points as normal.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
