This attack deals 4d6 additional psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or until the start of its next turn, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks and it cannot take reactions.

If your target is an aberration or it can speak telepathically this bonus psychic damage increases by 1d6.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th-level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 4th.
