You perform a hymn that inspires those who hear it to shake off potent effects. Creatures of your choice within range that can hear you can immediately repeat a saving throw to end one hostile effect or spell that is currently affecting it, adding your spellcasting modifier (minimum: +1) to their roll.

As a bonus action on each subsequent turn, you can use an instrument to continue the hymn and allow a creature of your choice that can hear you in range to gain these benefits again.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the range of the spell increases by 10 feet.
