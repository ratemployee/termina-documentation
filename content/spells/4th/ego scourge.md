You strike at the mind of a creature you can see within range, attacking its very sense of self. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and it cannot cast spells. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw.  

On a successful save, this effect ends on the target.
