This spell transforms one creature you can see within range into a new form of your choice. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist this effect, but shapechangers automatically succeed on their saving throw. This spell has no effect on a target that has 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, but it ends early if the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.

_**Form.**_ The new form can be any beast you have physically seen while it was living. It must have a Challenge Rating less than or equal to the target's level or its Challenge Rating.

_**Statistics.**_ Its game statistics, including its mental ability scores are replaced by those of the beast, but it does retain its alignment and personality within the limitations of that beast.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it was transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. If this excess damage reduces its normal form to 0 hit points, it is knocked unconscious.

_**Actions.**_ The actions the creature can take are limited to those its new form is able to perform. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.

_**Equipment.**_ Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
