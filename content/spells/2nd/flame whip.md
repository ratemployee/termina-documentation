In place of an attack, you can evoke a whip of pure flame in a free hand, that lasts for the duration. If you let go of the whip, it disappears, but you can evoke this Flame Whip again in place of another attack without expending a spell slot.

Whenever you could make an attack, you can instead make a melee spell attack with your Flame Whip against one target within 10 feet that you can see. On hit, it takes fire damage equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting modifier, and if the target is Large or smaller you can instantly grapple it with the Whip.

You cannot attack with the Whip while it is grappling a creature, but a grappled creature takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of its turn and can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, escaping on a success.

While in your hand, your Flame Whip sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both instances of fire damage dealt increase by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
