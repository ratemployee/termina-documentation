Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. It can be  a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of  
a specific kind (such as a bear, oak, or horse), so long as you have seen such a creature within 30 feet at least once.

If one is within 1 mile, the material component of this spell points to it as if it were a compass. If the target is in motion, it points to it for as long as it remains in range. If the creature is in a different form, such as under the effect of the¬†[[polymorph]]¬†spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

This spell can't locate its target if any thickness of lead or 10 feet of running water blocks a straight line to the target.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the range and the type of creature you can locate increase as show in the table below:

| **Slot Level** | **Range** |             **Creature Types**             |
| :------------: | :-------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|      3rd       |  2 miles  | Dragon, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze |
|      4th       |  3 miles  |       Aberration, Construct, Undead        |
|      5th       |  5 miles  |      Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend      |
