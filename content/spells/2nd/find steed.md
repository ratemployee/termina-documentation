You conjure a spirit in an unoccupied space within range that assumes the form of a supernaturally intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, which is instantly bonded to you. The Steed takes on the form of a Medium or Large quadrupedal beast that you have seen before with a CR of 1/2 or lower that does not have a climbing, flying, or swimming speed. Examples include: elk, camel, giant goat, mastiff, pony, or warhorse.

Your Steed uses the stat block of the form chosen for it, but its creature type now reflects your alignment: celestial (good), fey (neutral), or fiend (evil). The Steed's Intelligence becomes 6 if it was lower, and it understands one language you speak.

In combat, the Steed shares your initiative and acts during your turn. You control the Steed and choose how it acts, both in and out of combat. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

While you and your Steed are within 1 mile of one another, you can use a special form of telepathy to communicate.

If your Steed is reduced to 0 hit points it disappears. You can also use a bonus action to dismiss your Steed, causing it to disappear. Should you cast this spell again you can choose to either conjure the same Steed, and it reappears in range at its maximum hit points, or to conjure a new Steed, releasing your previous Steed from its bond in the process.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, your Steed can take on the form of any Medium or Large quadrupedal or winged beast, celestial, or monstrosity that you have seen before that has a CR of 2 or lower. Examples include: dire wolf, griffon, pegasus, peryton, polar bear, or rhinoceros.
