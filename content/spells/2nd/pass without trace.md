A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, you and creatures of your choice within 30 feet are considered to be lightly obscured and gain a bonus to all Dexterity (Stealth) checks equal to your Spellcasting modifier. Creatures under the effect of this spell leave no track or trace of their passing.
