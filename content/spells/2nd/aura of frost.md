Arcane frost, snow, and wind swirl about you in an aura with a 10-foot radius, and until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. When a creature other than you, enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it takes 2d8 cold damage and have its speed is reduced by 20 feet until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much cold damage and its speed isn't reduced.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, a creature that fails its save takes an additional 1d8 cold damage and has its speed reduced by an additional 10 feet for each spell level above 2nd.
