When you hit with a melee weapon attack you can cause the weapon to gleam with an otherworldly astral radiance. This attack deals 2d8 bonus radiant damage, and the target sheds dim light out to a 5-foot radius until the spell ends. The target also becomes visible if it was invisible and it cannot become invisible by magical or mundane means for the duration.

If your target is a fiend or undead, or if it has the sunlight sensitivity trait, the bonus radiant damage increases by 1d8.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2nd.
