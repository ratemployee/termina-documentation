You plant three pieces of ranged weapon ammunition in the ground within range and transmute them to protect the area. The first creature to move within 30 feet of this enchanted ammunition must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, and half as much piercing damage on a successful save.

As part of casting this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be transmuted increases by two for each slot level above 2nd. For each additional piece of ammunition you transmute with this spell, the damage increases by 1d6.
