You channel necrotic spiritual power to your hand, changing it into a withered specter of itself. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On hit, the creature takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and you gain 1d4 temporary hit points which last for the duration of your concentration.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ The damage of this spell, and the temporary hit points you gain, increase by 1d8 and 1d4 respectively when you reach 5th level (2d8 and 2d4), 11th level (3d8 and 3d4), and 17th level (4d8 and 4d4).
