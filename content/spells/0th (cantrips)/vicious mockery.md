You unleash a string of provoking words at a creature that can hear and understand you within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on every attack roll against targets other than you until the start of your next turn.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th (2d4), 11th (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
