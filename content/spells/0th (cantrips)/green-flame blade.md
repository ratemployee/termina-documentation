As a bonus action, you wreathe the melee weapon used in the casting of this spell with emerald flames. Until the start   of your next turn, your attacks with that weapon deal fire damage in place of the weapon's normal damage type.

Once per casting when you deal fire damage with this spell, you can cause the flames to leap to another creature you can see within 5 feet of your target, dealing 1d6 fire damage to it.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†The fire damage dealt to the second creature by this spell increases at 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).
