You project a beam of twinkling lights at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 radiant damage. Until a creature uses an action to remove the glitter, a target hit by this spell emits bright light in a 5-foot radius and has disadvantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes to hide or conceal itself.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ The damage of this spell increases by 1d8 at 5th (2d8), 11th (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
