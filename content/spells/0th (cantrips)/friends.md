You lace your words with soothing magic and force a creature of your choice that can hear and understand you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at that creature for the duration.

On a successful save, the creature realizes that you used magic to attempt to influence it and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you, and other creatures might seek retribution against you in other ways.
