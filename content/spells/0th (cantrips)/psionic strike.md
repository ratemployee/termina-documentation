As part of an unarmed strike, you manifest a blade of psionic energy in your hand. On hit, the target takes psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. Your hand immediately reverts to its normal appearance at the end of the attack.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ The damage die of this spell increases at 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).
