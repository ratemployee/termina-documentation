As a bonus action, you wreathe the melee weapon used in the casting of this spell with thunderous magic. Until the start of your next turn, your attacks with that weapon deal thunder damage in place of the weapon's normal damage type.

Once per casting when you deal thunder damage with this spell, you can envelop your target in thunderous energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, this thunderous energy explodes and it takes 1d6 thunder damage.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ The thunder damage dealt by this spell when the creature moves at least 5 feet increases at 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).
