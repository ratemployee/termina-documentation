You let forth a wail filled with otherworldly power. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 thunder damage and be deafened for the duration. At the end of each turn, targets can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on a success. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not deafened.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
