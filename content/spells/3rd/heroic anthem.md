You play an anthem that inspires heroic action. Creatures of your choice within range that can hear you can add your spellcasting modifier (minimum : +1) to any attack rolls they make before the beginning of your next turn.

As a bonus action on each subsequent turn, you can use an instrument to continue this anthem and repeat its effect.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When cast with a slot of 4th-level or higher, its range increases by 10 feet for each level above 3rd.
