`duration`

`ritual`

You fire one piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical thrown weapon into the air and choose a point within the normal range of the weapon.

The ammunition or weapon explodes into a multitude of exact copies of it, which fall in a 30-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on the point you chose. Creatures within that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d8 damage of the weapon or ammunition's type on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful save. Any pieces of ammunition or weapons created by this spell disintegrate once the effects of this spell are resolved.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d8, and the radius of the cylinder increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
