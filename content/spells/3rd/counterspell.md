You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails, and does not have its original effect. As part of the same action, the creature can salvage the remains of the spell, immediately casting a cantrip as part of the same action. The cantrip must be of the same school of magic as the initial spell attempted. 

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
