As part of a ranged weapon attack, you can transmute a piece of ammunition, or the thrown weapon, into a bolt of lightning. On hit, the target takes the normal damage of the attack, plus a bonus 4d8 lighting damage. On a miss, the target takes half as much lightning damage, and none of the normal damage.

Regardless if this attack hits or misses, all creatures within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 2d8 lighting damage, and half as much lighting damage on a success. The piece of ammunition or thrown weapon then returns to its normal form.

Any creature that takes lighting damage from this spell cannot take reactions until the beginning of your next turn.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
