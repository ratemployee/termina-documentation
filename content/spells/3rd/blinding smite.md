When you hit with a melee weapon attack you can cause the weapon to flare with an overwhelming blinding light. This attack deals 3d8 bonus radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the spell ends. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

If your target is a fiend or undead, or if it has the sunlight sensitivity trait, the bonus radiant damage increases by 1d8.

_**At Higher Levels.**_¬†When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2nd.
