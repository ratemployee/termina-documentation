You conjure a spear of caustic acid and make a ranged spell attack against a creature or object you can see within range. On hit, your target takes 4d10 acid damage and its Armor Class is reduced by 2. This spell cannot cause a creature to have an Armor Class lower then 10.

A creature can use an action to scrape the acid from this spell off the target, returning its Armor Class to normal.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and it further reduces the target's Armor Class by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
