Your mind unleashes a mental thrust of overwhelming force in a 30-foot cone. Each creature within the area of this spell must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 magical bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet directly away from you, and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and remains in place.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the magical bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3rd.
