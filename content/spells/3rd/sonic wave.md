You forcefully clasp your hands and a shockwave of booming force shoots forth from you and emits a boom audible out to 500 feet. All creatures in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d8 thunder damage, fall prone, and be deafened for 1 minute. On a success, creatures take half damage and are not knocked prone or deafened.

A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8, and the cone increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
