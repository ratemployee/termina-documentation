### deft explorer
You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.
#### canny
You can speak, read, and write 2 additional languages of your choice.
#### roving
At 6th level, your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
#### tireless
At 10th level, as an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.
### favored foe
You focus your senses to hunt as a predator of the wild. You can use a bonus action to mark one creature you can see as your Quarry, gaining the benefits below:
- Whenever you deal damage to it, you deal bonus damage equal to one roll of your Quarry Die, which is a d4.
- Whenever you make an ability check to track or locate it, you can add one roll of your Quarry Die to your d20 roll.

These benefits last for 1 hour but end early if your Quarry is slain or if you mark another creature as your Quarry. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot to use this feature again.

When you reach 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels in this class, both the duration of Ranger's Quarry and the size of your Quarry Die increase, as indicated in the Ranger table.
### knacks
In the wild, you have learned bits of primal knowledge, known as Knacks, which bolster your hunting, survival, and tracking skills. You know one Knack of your choice from the list of [[ranger knacks]].

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Knack you know with a Knack of your choice, so long as you meet the prerequisites for that Knack. You cannot replace a Knack that is a prerequisite for another Knack you know.

At certain Ranger levels, you learn additional Knacks, as shown in the Knacks Known column of the Ranger table.
### wild expertise
Your skill at navigating the wilderness is without peer. Choose one skill that you are proficient in. You add double your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make with the chosen skill.

When you reach 9th level in this class, you choose another skill that you are proficient in to gain this benefit.
### spellcasting
At 2nd level, you learn to draw upon the primal magic of the natural world to enhance your survival and combat skills. You gain the following benefits:
#### preparing and casting spells
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells. To cast a Ranger spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all of your expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, you prepare a list of spells that are available for you to cast. Choose a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Ranger level, rounded down. Spells must be from the [[paladin spell list]] at the end of this class, and be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells; your power is drawn from your intuitive knowledge of nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a ranger spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
#### spellcasting focus
You can use a druidic focus as the spellcasting focus for your Ranger spells.
#### ritual casting
Your knowledge of the natural world allows you to draw out its innate magic. You can cast any Ranger spell that you have prepared as a ritual as long as that spell has the ritual tag.
### fighting style
Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

$\quad$ `archery` You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.

$\quad$ `blind warrior` You have blindsight with a range in feet equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. In that range, you can see invisible targets and anything that isn't behind total cover or hidden from you.

$\quad$ `brawler` Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you have two free hands and use your action to make only unarmed strikes, you can make a single unarmed strike as a bonus action on that turn.

$\quad$ `druidic warrior.` You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[druid spell list]], and they count as Ranger spells for you. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one of these Druid cantrips you know with another Druid cantrip of your choice.

$\quad$ `defensive fighting` So long as you are either wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

$\quad$ `dual wielding` When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make the single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your action instead of your bonus action, adding your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.,

$\quad$ `dueling` When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with it.

$\quad$ `featherweight fighting` While you are wielding only light weapons, and nothing else, your speed increases by 10 feet. You also gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with light weapons, so long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield.

$\quad$ `mariner` When you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

$\quad$ `melee marksman` Having a hostile creature within 5 feet of you doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attacks, so long as you are attacking a creature within 5 feet. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet, you can use your bonus action to make a melee attack against it with your ranged weapon. On a hit, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.

$\quad$ `mountaineer` While you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

$\quad$ `mounted warrior` While you are riding a controlled mount, both you and your mount gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class, and you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to command the mount to take one action from its stat block.

$\quad$ `strongbow` You can use your Strength modifier, in place of Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with longbows and shortbows. When you do so, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with those weapons.

$\quad$ `thrown weapon fighting` You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. Moreover, when you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll of that attack.

$\quad$ `versatile fighting` While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls with that weapon. While doing so, you can also use your bonus action to make a single grapple or shove attack, or to take the Use an Object action.
### primal awareness
At 3rd level, you can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you always have certain spells prepared when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of Ranger spells you can prepare.
##### primal awareness spells
| **Ranger Level** | **Spell**               |
| :--------------: | :---------------------- |
|       3rd        | [[speak with animals]]  |
|       5th        | [[beast sense]]         |
|       9th        | [[speak with plants]]   |
|       13th       | [[locate creature]]     |
|       17th       | [[commune with nature]] |
### ranger conclave
When you reach 3rd level, you choose your Conclave, a loose association of Rangers that share similar abilities, from the options below:

- [[beast master conclave]]
- [[buccaneer conclave]]
- [[deep stalker conclave]]

- [[fey wanderer conclave]]
- [[grim warden conclave]]
- [[hunter conclave]]

- [[trapper conclave]]
- [[wastelander conclave]]

Your choice of Conclave grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 7th, 11th, and 15th level in this class.
#### conclave spells
Each Ranger Conclave has a list of Conclave Spells that you always have prepared once you reach the Ranger levels noted in your Conclave's description. Your Conclave Spells count as Ranger spells for you, but they do not count against your total number of spells that you can prepare each day.
#### divine fervor
The righteous power of your Sacred Oath is represented by a pool of Divine Fervor used to fuel various Paladin and Oath features. You have an amount of Divine Fervor equal to your Paladin level + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 0). You regain expended Divine Fervor when you finish a long rest.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### extra attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
### unerring
You hunt with the skills of an apex predator. At 5th level, you can't have disadvantage on attack rolls against your Quarry.
### land's stride
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the [[entangle]] spell.
### nature's veil
Starting at 10th level, you learn to draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### tireless
You are always ready for another hunt, never letting your foes rest. Beginning at 11th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Favored Foe whenever you finish a short or long rest.
### vanish
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
### feral senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. You cannot have disadvantage on attack rolls against any target within 30 feet of you.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.
### foe slayer
You are a Ranger of mythic skill, rivaling the great huntsmen of legend. At 20th level, whenever you hit your Quarry with a weapon attack, you can immediately end the mark and cause that attack to deal maximum damage instead of rolling. If the attack reduces the creature to 50 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or instantly be reduced to 0 hit points.
