> While all rangers have some skill with snares and traps, few are true masters of the craft. These Trappers are meticulous planners with mechanical minds who use their skills to plan ambushes and set snares for their foes. They have a talent for anticipating their foe's next move and laying the perfect trip.

### meticulous fingers
`3rd-LEVEL trapper conclave FEATURE`

You are exceptionally gifted with mechanical objects and traps. You gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand and with thieves' tools and tinker's tools, and whenever you make an ability check with these tools or skill, you add one roll of your Quarry Die to the result.

Moreover, your precise hands allow you to take the Use an Objection action as a bonus action on your turn.
### trap adept
`3rd-LEVEL trapper conclave FEATURE`

You learn the [[ranger knacks#trapper|trapper]] Knack, but it does not count against your total Knacks Known. If you already know the [[ranger knacks#trapper|trapper]] Knack, you can learn another Knack of your choice.

Also, when you have access to the inner workings of a trap that has been disarmed, you can use tinker's tools to rearm the trap (so long as rearming it is possible), and when you do so, its new DC is equal to your spell save DC.
### combat snares
`7th-LEVEL trapper conclave FEATURE`

You can quickly assemble and utilize makeshift traps in combat. As an action, you can craft a Trap (using the [[ranger knacks#trapper|trapper]] Knack) and throw it at a space you can see within 20 feet. Creatures in the space of the Trap must make a saving throw as if it had moved into the Trap's space, suffering its effects on a failed save as normal. Traps crafted in this way only last for 1 minute.

You can also take the Use an Object action to throw a Trap that you had already crafted (for example, the Traps crafted with the [[ranger knacks#trapper|trapper]] Knack) at a creature in this way.
### deadly snares
`11th-LEVEL trapper conclave FEATURE`

A creature marked as your Quarry has disadvantage on its initial saving throw against Traps you created or modified, and it automatically fails its initial saving throw against your Traps if it is unaware of the Trap's location.
### greater traps
`11th-LEVEL trapper conclave FEATURE`

Your skills as a Trapper have grown. At the end of each long rest, you craft a number of Traps (with [[ranger knacks#trapper|trapper]]) equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 2 Traps).

Additionally, any Traps you craft with [[ranger knacks#trapper|trapper]] now work on creatures that are Huge or smaller, and if a creature makes a saving throw against your Trap, it takes magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) equal to three rolls of your Quarry Die on a failure, and half that on a success.
### master of traps
`15th-LEVEL trapper conclave FEATURE`

You are always ready to lay a trap. When you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to craft one Trap and throw it to one unoccupied space you can see within 20 feet of you.

Also, whenever you craft a Trap, you can choose whether it takes up a 10-foot square or a single 5-foot square.
