> In their role as guardians of nature, some rangers form deep connections with the beasts of the wild. In recognition of this relationship, great spirits of the wild known as Primal Beasts will seek out such rangers and form a primal bond. Together, master and beast stand together to defend the natural world.

### primal beast
`3rd-LEVEL beast master conclave FEATURE`

You have formed a bond with a Primal Beast. You choose its stat block from one of the following options: the Beast of the Cave, Land, Sea, or Sky, each of which is detailed below. The Primal Beast stat blocks use your proficiency bonus (PB) and spell save DC.

Your Primal Beast is friendly to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. In combat, it acts on your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to order it to take an action from its stat block, or another action. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can forgo one attack to command your Beast to attack.

When you are incapacitated, your Beast can act on its own, but it uses its turns to defend both itself and you to the best of its abilities.

If your Beast is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. If the Beast dies, you can perform a special 1-hour ritual, which can be during a short or long rest, that returns your Primal Beast to life with 1 hit point. As part of this ritual, the Beast can expend Hit Dice to regain additional hit points. It can also take a new form, choosing a new Primal Beast stat block and appearance.
### wild empathy
`3rd-LEVEL beast master conclave FEATURE`

You learn the [[ranger knacks#wild insight i|Wild Insight I]] Knack, but it doesn't count against your Knacks Known. If you already know this Knack, you learn another Knack.
### bestial focus
`7th-LEVEL beast master conclave FEATURE`

You and your Beast hunt as one. Your Primal Beast gains all benefits of your [[ranger class overview#favored foe|favored foe]], including any Knacks that enhance it, and its attacks count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
### exceptional training
`11th-LEVEL beast master conclave FEATURE`

You are able to draw out the full ferocity of your Primal Beast. Once per turn when you command your Primal Beast to use one of the attacks from its stat block, it can make two attacks.
### primal bond
`15th-LEVEL beast master conclave FEATURE`

The bond with your Primal Beast has reached its apex. When you cast a Ranger spell that targets yourself, the Primal Beast also gains the benefits as long as it is within 30 feet of you.
