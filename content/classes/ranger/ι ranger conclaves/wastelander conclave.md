> While all rangers have the skills to survive in the wilds, those known as Wastelanders are true masters of survival. Rugged wanderers, they have adapted to survive in the harshest lands imaginable: arid deserts, frozen tundra, great alpine heights, and magical wastelands. These survivalists combine a talent for illusion magic and protective gear to survive anywhere.

### wasteland weaver
`3rd-LEVEL wastelander conclave FEATURE`

You have mastered an ancient pattern of enhancing clothing, which enables a supernatural level of survivability. You gain proficiency with weaver's tools, and you can add double your proficiency bonus to any check you make with these tools.

At the end of each long rest, you can use weaver's tools to enhance one set of clothing or cloak. While a creature wears this enhanced garment, it gains the following benefits:
- It gains a bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in wasteland and wilds equal to one roll of your Quarry Die.
- It requires one-quarter as much water in order to survive.
- It has advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of harsh environments and subsequent exhaustion levels.

During each long rest, you must spend 1 hour maintaining any garments you have enhanced or they lose these beneficial properties. You can maintain a number of garments equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1 set of garments).
### wilderness adept
`3rd-LEVEL wastelander conclave FEATURE`

You are able to survive the most inhospitable environments. You learn one of the following Knacks of your choice: [[ranger knacks#alpine adept|alpine adept]], [[ranger knacks#aquatic adept|aquatic adept]], [[ranger knacks#arctic adept|arctic adept]], [[ranger knacks#desert adept|desert adept]], or [[ranger knacks#jungle adept|jungle adept]]. You learn another at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.

Starting at 7th level, you can choose [[ranger knacks#planar adept|planar adept]] as the Knack you learn from this feature. The Knacks you gain this way do not count against your number of Knacks Known.
### rugged resilience
`7th-LEVEL wastelander conclave FEATURE`

You imbue the mystical weave of your enhanced garments with illusion magic. A creature wearing one of your enhanced garments can use a bonus action to cast [[invisibility]] on itself.

It can do so three times, but when the last use is expended, the garment loses any beneficial properties. Your enhanced garments regain all uses of this feature when you spend time during a long rest maintaining your enhanced garments.
### illusory strikes
`11th-LEVEL wastelander conclave FEATURE`

You enhance your combat style with potent illusion magic. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to create an Illusory Duplicate of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. It makes one attack with a duplicate of your weapon, which deals force damage in place of your weapon's damage and disappears.
### mirage transposition
`15th-LEVEL wastelander conclave FEATURE`

You can use a bonus action to create your Illusory Duplicate even if you do not take the Attack action. When you conjure an Illusory Duplicate, you can instantly switch places with it.
