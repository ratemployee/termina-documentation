### extraplanar senses
`3rd-LEVEL planar warden conclave FEATURE`

As an action, you can detect the exact distance and direction of the nearest creature alien to your current plane or planar portal within 1 mile that isn't shielded from divination magic. As part of this action, you can exclude targets of your choice.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to use this again.
### planar warrior
`3rd-LEVEL planar warden conclave FEATURE`

You can augment your strikes with extraplanar energies. You can choose for the additional damage of [[ranger class overview#favored foe|favored foe]] to be force damage in place of your weapon's damage type.

Moreover, you can mark any creatures not native to your current plane of existence as your Quarry without expending a use of Favored Foe. For example, while you are on the Material Plane, you can use this feature to mark aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends as your Quarry.
### ethereal step
`7th-LEVEL planar warden conclave FEATURE`

You can briefly move between planes to disorient your foes. When you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.

Any distance you teleport with this feature counts against your total movement for your turn.
### empowered strikes
`11th-LEVEL planar warden conclave FEATURE`

Your ability to move between the planes has improved. If you use Ethereal Step and attack at least two different creatures with that action, you can make one additional attack as part of that Attack action against a third creature.

In addition, when you use Ethereal Step and then make an attack, you can choose for your attack to deal force damage.
### ethereal defense
`15th-LEVEL planar warden conclave FEATURE`

You can partially phase out of your current plane to resist the assaults of your foes. When you take damage from an attack or spell that you can see, you can use your reaction to grant yourself resistance to the damage of that attack for this turn.
