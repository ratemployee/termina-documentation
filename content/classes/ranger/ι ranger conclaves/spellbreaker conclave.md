> Spellbreakers are a small but dedicated Conclave of rangers that specialize in hunting mages who use their arcane power for evil. While most pursue the life of a Spellbreaker for noble reasons, there are some who seek to destroy anyone with the potential to use magic. Most Spellbreakers work in secrecy, only striking when success is a certainty. If a wrong move could end in disintegration, there is no room for error.

### mage breaker
`3rd-LEVEL spellbreaker conclave FEATURE`

You ward your weapon with antimagic enchantments. When you hit your Quarry with a weapon attack, it has disadvantage on its subsequent Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on spells.

Also, whenever you see or hear a creature within your reach attempt to cast a spell, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against it.
### spellsight
`3rd-LEVEL spellbreaker conclave FEATURE`

You have learned to see the arcane potential of creatures. When you mark a creature as your Quarry, you instantly learn its spellcasting ability (if it has one) and the level of the highest level spell that it has the ability to cast.

If your Quarry is hidden from divination magic, such as by a [[nondetection]] spell, it appears as if it cannot cast spells.
### arcane defense
`7th-LEVEL spellbreaker conclave FEATURE`

You can steel yourself to better resist the magics of your foes. Whenever your Quarry forces you to make a saving throw to resist a spell or another magical effect, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1).

Moreover, whenever your Quarry subjects you to a spell or magical effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a success, and only half damage on a failed saving throw.
### spellbane
`11th-LEVEL spellbreaker conclave FEATURE`

You are an unparalleled hunter of mages. Whenever you hit your Quarry with a weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to deal bonus force damage equal to one roll of your Quarry Die per level of the spell slot.

Also, whenever you cast [[counterspell]] or [[dispel magic]], you can add a roll of your Quarry Die to the ability check.
### mantle of the master
`15th-LEVEL spellbreaker conclave FEATURE`

Your Spellbreaker training has reached its pinnacle. You are resistant to damage from spells and all other magical effects so long as you are not unconscious or incapacitated.
### reflect spell
`15th-LEVEL spellbreaker conclave FEATURE`

Your training allows you to strike spells from the weave. You can cast [[absorb elements]] at will as if you cast it at 1st-level.

After you cast [[absorb elements]], if your next melee weapon attack is against the creature whose spell you absorbed, you treat the [[absorb elements]] damage as its maximum amount.
