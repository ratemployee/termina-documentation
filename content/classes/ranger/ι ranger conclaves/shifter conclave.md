> While all rangers have a unique bond with the wilds, those who join the Conclave of Shifters take this bond to its extreme. Using the ancient and powerful magic of druids, these rangers are able to change their physical form and take on the shape of beasts they defend. They use this primal power to stand as guardians of all wildlife and the natural world.

### limited wild shape
`3rd-LEVEL shifter conclave FEATURE`

You can draw on primal nature magic to take the shape of beasts, much like a druid does. You gain the ability to Wild Shape. As a bonus action on your turn, you can use this ability to assume the form of any beast that you have physically touched while it was living.

Your Ranger level determines the maximum CR of the beasts that you can transform into, as shown in the table below. You must obey all the other rules for Wild Shape as they are detailed in the druid's [[druid class overview#wild shape|wild shape]] feature.

| **Ranger Level** | **Max CR** |    **Beast Limitations**    | **Example Beasts** |
| :--------------: | :--------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------: |
|       3rd        |    1/4     | No flying or swimming speed |      Panther       |
|       7th        |    1/2     |       No flying speed       |     Reef Shark     |
|       11th       |     1      |              —              |    Giant Eagle     |
|       17th       |     2      |              —              |     Cave Bear      |
You can stay in Wild Shape for up to one hour, at which point you revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier if you use a bonus action to do so, or if you fall unconscious, you drop to 0 hit points, or you die.

Once you use your Wild Shape, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to use Wild Shape again.
### wild empathy
`3rd-LEVEL shifter conclave FEATURE`

The nature magic you wield enables a bond with the beasts you defend. You learn the [[ranger knacks#wild insight i|wild insight i]] Knack, but it does not count against your number of Knacks Known. If you already know [[ranger knacks#wild insight i|wild insight i]], you instead learn another Knack of your choice that you meet the prerequisites for.
### druidic soul
`7th-LEVEL shifter conclave FEATURE`

The primal power you channel grants you the abilities of a true druid. You learn to speak Druidic, and you can use it to decode and leave hidden messages for other druids. You also count as a druid for the purposes of attuning to magic items.

Finally, your Wild Shape form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities.
### empowered shapes
`11th-LEVEL shifter conclave FEATURE`

You can infuse your Wild Shape transformation with primal magic. As part of the bonus action you use to Wild Shape, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to exceed the normal CR limitations of Wild Shape. When you do so, you can transform into a beast with a CR equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you expended to transform.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can empower Wild Shape in this way again.

Moreover, you can roll your Quarry Die for the damage die of your Wild Shape form attacks unless the form's is higher.
### thousand forms
`15th-LEVEL shifter conclave FEATURE`

You are so in tune with your abilities that you can transform your normal form in subtle ways at will. You can cast [[alter self]] at will, targeting only yourself, without expending a spell slot.
