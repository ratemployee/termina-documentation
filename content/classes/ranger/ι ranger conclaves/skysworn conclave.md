> While most rangers are masters of the terrestrial wilderness, those known as Skysworn defend the great open skies. Often organized in small fraternities, this order of rangers master a style of elemental magic that grants power over air. These aerial rangers use this elemental air magic to empower their attacks, enhance their skills, and even to take flight.

### skysworn armor
`3rd-LEVEL skysworn conclave FEATURE`

You have enchanted your armor with the power of elemental air. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can enchant a set of light armor that you touch, transforming it into a set of Skysworn Armor.

You can only have one set of Skysworn Armor at a time. Enchanting another set immediately dispels the benefits for any previous set. Only you can wear and benefit from a set of Skysworn Armor, and it grants you the following benefits:
- The Armor has a number of charges equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 2), and it regains all of its expended charges when you finish a short or long rest.
- As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to fly in a straight line up to 30 feet. Creatures in your flight path must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. They take thunder damage equal to three rolls of your Quarry Die on a failure, and half a success. This flight does not count against your total movement.
- You can cast [[feather fall]] without expending a spell slot.
- You can add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to any Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks you make.

When your Skysworn Armor has no charges remaining, you can use an action to touch the Armor and expend a spell slot. Your Armor regains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot you expended, up to its maximum Charges.
### storm strike
`3rd-LEVEL skysworn conclave FEATURE`

You can empower your weapon strikes with the thunderous elemental magic you wield. When you hit your Quarry with a weapon attack, you can expend a charge from your Skysworn Armor to deal additional thunder damage to your target equal to three rolls of your Quarry Die.
### tempestuous magics
`7th-LEVEL skysworn conclave FEATURE`

You have enchanted your Skysworn Armor with tempestuous magics. While your Skysworn Armor has at least 1 charge, it grants you a 40 foot flying speed, and you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to your Dexterity saving throws.
### thunderous flight
`11th-LEVEL skysworn conclave FEATURE`

You can channel the thunderous might of the greatest storms. When you expend a charge of your Skysworn Armor to fly in a straight line, you add your Wisdom modifier to the thunder damage you deal to targets. Moreover, any Large or smaller creature that fails its Dexterity saving throw falls prone.

In addition, when you are flying with your Skysworn Armor, any opportunity attacks made against you have disadvantage.
### sonic eruption
`15th-LEVEL skysworn conclave FEATURE`

You can erupt with a burst of thunderous force. As an action, you can expend charges of your Skysworn Armor (up to your Wisdom modifier) to emit a burst of thunderous force, forcing targets of your choice within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. They take thunder damage equal to two rolls of your Quarry Die for each Charge expended on a failure, and half that on a success. Huge or smaller creatures that fail are also knocked prone.

Finally, the flying speed granted by your Skysworn Armor increases to 60 feet so long as it has at least 1 charge.
