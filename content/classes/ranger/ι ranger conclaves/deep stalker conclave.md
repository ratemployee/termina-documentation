> Deep beneath the earth where the light of the sun is a dream, nameless things dwell in the deep shadow. The rangers who stand against these unspeakable terrors of the darkness are known as Deep Stalkers. Though their skills were originally developed by denizens of the Underdark, Deep Stalkers can be found guarding anywhere darkness lies heavy on the land.

### umbral sight
`3rd-LEVEL deep stalker conclave FEATURE`

You have adapted to stalk prey without light. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from another feature, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.
### dread ambusher
`3rd-LEVEL deep stalker conclave FEATURE`

You mimic the surprise tactics of the nameless creatures that dwell in the darkness. You gain a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1), so long as you are not surprised or incapacitated.

Also, when you take the Attack action during your first turn in combat, you can make one additional attack as part of that action. On hit, it deals bonus damage equal to your level.
### cloak of shadows
`7th-LEVEL deep stalker conclave FEATURE`

You have learned to conceal yourself even from the creatures native to the deep shadow. While you are in darkness, you are invisible to creatures that rely on darkvision to see you.
### iron mind
`7th-LEVEL deep stalker conclave FEATURE`

You have trained your mind to resist the mental assaults that are common in the depths you stalk. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you are already proficient, you gain proficiency in either Intelligence or Charisma saving throws.
### precise strikes
`11th-LEVEL deep stalker conclave FEATURE`

In the unforgiving dark, every strike could be the difference between life and death. Once per turn when you miss with a weapon attack, you can add one roll of your Quarry Die to your attack roll, possibly turning your miss into a hit.

In addition, your darkvision has improved, allowing you to see through both magical and nonmagical darkness.
### deadly counter
`15th-LEVEL deep stalker conclave FEATURE`

You can manipulate the shadows to distract your foes. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to cloak yourself in shadows and impose disadvantage on its attack roll.

If this reaction causes the attack to miss, you can make a weapon attack against your attacker as part of the same reactoon. If you are in dim light or darkness when you make this special attack, you have advantage on your attack roll.
