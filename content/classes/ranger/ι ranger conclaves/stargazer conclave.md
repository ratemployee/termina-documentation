> Since ancient times, mortals have looked to the stars of night for stories of the past, omens for the present, and portents of the future. The rangers known as Stargazers dedicate their lives to the study of stars and constellations, and can draw on their radiant power to conjure celestial magic, vanquish their foes, and twist the threads of fate for those around them.

#### stargazer conclave spells
You always have certain spells prepared at the Ranger levels in the table below. The spells count as Ranger spells for you, but they don't count against the spells you prepare each day.

| :--------------: | ------------------------------------- |

### constellation magic
`3rd-LEVEL stargazer conclave FEATURE`

You draw your power from the constellations of the night sky. Each time you finish a long rest, you attune yourself to one of the Constellations below. While attuned, you always have the corresponding Constellation spells, one cantrip and 1st-level spell, prepared. They become Ranger spells for you, but they don't count against the total number of spells you prepare. They also count as your Conclave Spells for 3rd level.

You can cast your 1st-level Constellation spell once, at the level of your highest level slot on the Ranger table, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest.

| **Constellation** |    **Cantrip**     | **1st-level Spell**  |
| :---------------: | :----------------: | :------------------: |
|       Adder       |   [[thorn whip]]   |  [[inflict wounds]]  |
|       Bear        |   [[resistance]]   |  [[wrathful smite]]  |
|     Elephant      |    [[guidance]]    |      [[bless]]       |
|     Snow Hare     | [[minor illusion]] | [[armor of agathys]] |
|       Stag        |   [[shillelagh]]   |     [[heroism]]      |
|       Wolf        |  [[true strike]]   |   [[guiding bolt]]   |
### celestial guidance
`3rd-LEVEL stargazer conclave FEATURE`

The constellations of the night sky guide your steps. You gain proficiency in your choice of either cartographer's tools or navigator's tools. Also, whenever you make an ability check with either set of tools, you add a roll of your Quarry Die to the result.

Finally, you can't become lost, even by magical means so long as you can see the stars of the night sky.
### threads of fate
`7th-LEVEL stargazer conclave FEATURE`

You can use the insights you gain from the stars to twist fate. When a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check or saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the result of its roll. You must use this reaction before you know if it succeeds or fails.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all of your
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### starlight strikes
`11th-LEVEL stargazer conclave FEATURE`

You infuse your weapons with the power of celestial starlight. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack or damage it with a ranger spell, you deal additional radiant damage equal to one roll of your Quarry Die.
### resplendent soul
`15th-LEVEL stargazer conclave FEATURE`

When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use a reaction to release a targeted flash of light toward it, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it takes radiant damage equal to three rolls of your Quarry Die, and the attack misses you.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to use this again.
