> Whether by birth, happenstance, or a ritual, the mind of every Nomad has been connected to the mystical web of knowledge that connects all mortal minds. This psionic link allows Nomads to access knowledge from far-off places and distant lives. These strange wanderers spend their lives collecting hidden lore to add to this web of information that connects every Nomad.

### expunging strikes
`3rd-LEVEL nomad conclave FEATURE`

You can imbue your strikes with your innate psionic power to disrupt your foe's mind. Once per turn when you hit your Quarry with a weapon attack, you can force it to make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, all damage dealt by your attack becomes psychic damage, and your Quarry can't see, hear, or sense you in any way until the start of your next turn.
### mystic knowledge
`3rd-LEVEL nomad conclave FEATURE`

You can use your connection to the world's mental network to draw knowledge from the Nomads of past and present. Each time you finish a long rest, you gain proficiency in one skill or tool, or learn to speak, read, and write a language of your choice. You retain the knowledge of this language or skill proficiency until the end of your next long rest.

Beginning at 11th level in this class, you gain two proficiencies or languages of your choice through this feature at the end of a long rest, following these rules.
### nomad's step
`7th-LEVEL nomad conclave FEATURE`

You can temporarily merge your consciousness with the world's mental network to avoid harm and move through the world in strange ways. You gain the two features below. You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

$\quad$ `phase defense.` When you are hit by an attack you can see, you can use a reaction to retreat into the network, causing that attack to miss. You then instantly reappear in an unoccupied space that you had occupied at some point since the beginning of your previous turn.

$\quad$ `psionic jaunt.` As a bonus action, you expend any amount of your remaining movement to instantly teleport a number of feet equal to the movement you expended, reappearing in an unoccupied space you can see within that range.
### strange movement
`11th-LEVEL nomad conclave FEATURE`

Your connection to the mental network has grown. You regain all uses of Nomad's Step when you finish a short or long rest.
### mystical burst
`15th-LEVEL nomad conclave FEATURE`

When reappearing from the network, you can assault your foes with the residual psionic power. When you teleport with a Nomad Spell or Nomad feature, you can force all creatures within 10 feet of the point you appear to make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. They take psychic damage equal to one roll of your Quarry Die on a failed save, and half as much on a successful saving throw.
