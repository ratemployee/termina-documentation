### beguiling strikes
`3rd-LEVEL fey wanderer conclave FEATURE`

You can weave the wild and disorienting magic of the Feywild into your strikes, distracting and taunting your foes. You can choose for the bonus damage of your [[ranger class overview#favored foe|favored foe]] feature to be psychic instead of your weapon's normal damage type.

If you deal psychic damage to your Quarry with a melee weapon attack, it has disadvantage on all attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.
### otherworldly mystique
`3rd-LEVEL fey wanderer conclave FEATURE`

The magic of the Feywild has imbued you with a whimsical that makes others more likely to trust you, for good or ill. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.

Also, when you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1).
### whimsical ward
`7th-LEVEL fey wanderer conclave FEATURE`

Your familiarity with the abilities of the fey grants you increased defenses against their power. You have advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed and frightened.

Also, when a creature you can see within 30 feet makes a saving throw to resist the charmed or frightened condition, you can use a reaction to force another creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it is either charmed or frightened of you (your choice) for 1 minute. The creature can repeat this saving at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a successful save.
### faerie guardian
`11th-LEVEL fey wanderer conclave FEATURE`

You can call support from the otherworldly courts of the fey. You can cast [[summon fey]] without its material components.

Also, once per long rest, when you cast [[summon fey]], you can cast it so that it does not require concentration. When you do, its duration is reduced from 1 hour to 1 minute.
### mirthful step
`15th-LEVEL fey wanderer conclave FEATURE`

You can step through the Feywild to move quickly from one place to another. You can cast [[misty step]] a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you cast [[misty step]], you can touch a willing creature within 5 feet and teleport it along with you. It reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where you reappear.
