> Swarm Keepers enter symbiotic relationships with swarms of tiny creatures. Most often surrounded by a swarm of rodents, insects, birds, or other small animals, these strange rangers see themselves as guardians of the smallest lives. Dwelling in the deep woods or underground caves, Swarm Keepers build communities that work together for the good of the swarm.

### symbiotic swarm
`3rd-LEVEL swarm keeper conclave FEATURE`

You have become an integral part of a swarm of vermin. You know the [[mage hand]] cantrip, but when you cast [[mage hand]], it manifests as part of your swarm which does your bidding.

Also, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to turns to command your swarm in one of the following ways:

$\quad$ `biting assault.` One creature of your choice within 30 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take piercing or poison damage equal to two rolls of your Quarry Die.

$\quad$ `harrying horde.` One creature of your choice within 30 feet must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice. Large and larger creatures have advantage on this Strength saving throw.

$\quad$ `swarm step.` You are moved up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice without provoking opportunity attacks.
### writhing horde
`7th-LEVEL swarm keeper conclave FEATURE`

You can compel your swarm to carry you in unnatural ways. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb sheer surfaces and upside down on ceilings without having to make an ability check. While climbing in this way, you are surrounded by your swarm of vermin.

Also, when you make a Strength (Athletics) check to shove or grapple, or to resist or end a grapple, you can call on your swarm and add one roll of your Quarry Die to your roll.
### greater swarm
`11th-LEVEL swarm keeper conclave FEATURE`

Your swarm has grown vastly in both numbers and in power. Your Quarry has disadvantage on saving throws against your Symbiotic Swarm features. Your Symbiotic Swarm features also gain the following additional benefits:

$\quad$ `biting assault.` On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of your next turn in addition to the damage.

$\quad$ `harrying horde.` On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone at the end of this forced movement.

$\quad$ `swarm step.` After you move, you also gain the benefits of half cover until the beginning of your next turn.
### one with the swarm
`15th-LEVEL swarm keeper conclave FEATURE`

You can fade into your swarm to avoid danger. When you take damage from a source you can see, you can use your reaction to become one with your swarm and give yourself resistance to that instance of damage. You and your swarm then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet.

You can use this special reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to use this special reaction again.
### swarm master
`15th-LEVEL swarm keeper conclave FEATURE`

You have become one with your swarm, and can command it with only your mind. You can cast one of your Swarm Keeper Spells without expending a spell slot or requiring the normal components, instead relying on your swarm to produce it.

Once you use this feature to cast a Swarm Keeper Spell in this way, you must finish a short or long rest before you can call on your swarm in this way again.
