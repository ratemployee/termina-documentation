> Sometimes it takes a monster to destroy a monster. Those who take up the mantle of Grim Warden undergo a sinister alchemical ritual, the Warden's Rite, which enhances their physical abilities. They sacrifice any chance they have at a normal life by mingling their blood with that of monsters, so they may gain unnatural power to destroy their foes.

### warden's rite
`3rd-LEVEL grim warden conclave FEATURE`

You have passed through the Warden's Rite, an unholy alchemical ritual that suffuses your blood with the sinister power of monsters. You change in the ways listed below, which cannot be reversed:
- You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies and in Religion. Whenever you make a check with either of these, you add one roll of your Quarry Die to your result.
- You count as a humanoid and monstrosity for magical purposes.
- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and increases by 1 again each time you gain a level in this class.
### crimson mark
`3rd-LEVEL grim warden conclave FEATURE`

You can use your sinister blood magic to empower the mark on your foes. Whenever you mark a creature as your Quarry, you can make a blood sacrifice instead of expending a use of [[ranger class overview#favored foe|favored foe]]. When you do, you reduce your current and maximum hit points by one roll of your Quarry Die.

Any reductions to your maximum hit points are undone at the end of your next long rest.

For the duration, you can choose for the bonus damage of Favored Foe to be necrotic. Necrotic damage dealt in this way ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance.

Finally, when you deal necrotic damage to your Quarry in this way, it cannot regain hit points for the next minute.
### dark augmentation
`7th-LEVEL grim warden conclave FEATURE`

The sinister magic in you enhances your physical capabilities. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Also, whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Quarry Die.
### greater crimson brand
`11th-LEVEL grim warden conclave FEATURE`

Powerful blood magic infuses all of your strikes. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d10 necrotic damage to it.
### sinister resilience
`11th-LEVEL grim warden conclave FEATURE`

The dark magic that flows in your blood grants you defenses against evil magicks. You gain resistance to necrotic damage, and when you reduce your hit points with Crimson Mark, you roll your Quarry Die twice and use the lower result.
### sanguine mastery
`15th-LEVEL grim warden conclave FEATURE`

The magic of your Warden's Rite manifests its full potential. You have advantage on saving throws to resist the frightened condition, and you are always under the effects of [[protection from evil and good]] while you are conscious.
