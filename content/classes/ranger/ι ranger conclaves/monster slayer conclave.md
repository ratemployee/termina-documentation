> Some rangers are driven from civilized life by a deep hatred for monsters. Often victims of these terrible monsters in their youth, those that take up the mantle of Monster Slayer travel the world hunting for vile supernatural creatures that prey on innocent mortals and ruthless annihilate them. They track down vampires, evil fey, restless spirits, werewolves, and any other vile creature and destroy them without hesitation.

### knowledge of the hunt
`3rd-LEVEL monster slayer conclave FEATURE`

You have dedicated yourself to the destruction of creatures of darkness, and you study their weaknesses. You gain proficiency in your choice of Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.

As a bonus action, you can analyse a creature you can see within 30 feet, making an ability check using the skill below corresponding to its creature type (DC equals 10 + its CR):

| **Skill** |          **Creature Type**          |
| :-------: | :---------------------------------: |
|  Arcana   | Aberrations, Dragons, Monstrosities |
|  History  |          Giants, Humanoids          |
|  Nature   |  Beasts, Elementals, Oozes, Plants  |
| Religion  |   Celestials, Fey, Fiends, Undead   |
On a successful check, you learn one of the following characteristics of your choice: its highest ability score, lowest ability score, its damage vulnerabilities, its damage resistances or immunities, its condition immunities, or another weakness it may have. If the characteristic you choose doesn't apply, the DM reveals another characteristic to you.

If you analyse your Quarry with this feature, you can add one roll of your Quarry Die to your ability check.
### slayer's cunning
`3rd-LEVEL monster slayer conclave FEATURE`

You are always prepared to hunt. You gain the [[ranger knacks#slayer i|slayer i]] Knack, but it does not count against your total number of Knacks Known.

You can also use Favored Foe once between each short or long rest without expending a use of it.
### iron focus
`7th-LEVEL monster slayer conclave FEATURE`

You have trained your mind to better resist the supernatural assaults of your hated foes. Whenever your Quarry forces you to make an ability check or saving throw, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Quarry Die.
### monster's nemesis
`11th-LEVEL monster slayer conclave FEATURE`

Your hatred for evil empowers your weapons. Your weapon attacks against your Quarry treat its damage immunities as resistances, and ignore any damage resistances it has.

Moreover, when your Quarry misses you with an attack or you succeed on a saving throw it forced you to make, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against it.
### ruthless counter
`15th-LEVEL monster slayer conclave FEATURE`

You do everything in your power to prevent the monsters you hunt from harming the innocent. When you see your Quarry attempt to cast a spell, teleport, or use another supernatural or magical ability from its stat block, you can make a single weapon attack against it as a reaction. On a hit, your Quarry must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell, teleport, or other ability is thwarted and fails to take effect.

When you use this feature and your attack hits, you can choose to instantly end the effects of Favored Foe to cause the creature to automatically fail its Wisdom saving throw.
