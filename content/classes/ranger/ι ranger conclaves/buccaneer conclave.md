> Combining their survival skills, affinity for nature magic, and passion for the high seas, Buccaneers are rangers who feel more at home on the water than on solid ground. Serving as sailors, pirates, marines, and privateers, they are often among the most valuable crew members on their vessel.

### sea legs
`3rd-LEVEL buccaneer conclave FEATURE`

The time you have spent at sea grants you abilities that land-locked rangers lack. You gain the benefits listed below:
- You gain the Mariner [[ranger class overview#fighting style|fighting style]]. If you already have this Fighting Style, you gain another Fighting Style of your choice from those available to the Ranger class.
- You learn the [[ranger knacks#aquatic adept|aquatic adept]] Knack, but it doesn't count against your total Knacks Known. If you already know this Knack, you learn another Knack of your choice.
- Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check that relies on your sense of sight, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Quarry Die. 
### windswept hide
`7th-LEVEL buccaneer conclave FEATURE`

Your experience has granted you increased resistance to the dangers of the sea. You gain resistance to cold, lightning, and thunder damage. Whenever you make an ability check or saving throw to resist being knocked prone or moved against your will, you add one roll of your Quarry Die to your roll.
### wrath of the sea
`11th-LEVEL buccaneer conclave FEATURE`

You carry the magic of the highs seas whether you are on sea or land. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can imbue the strike with watery magic, forcing it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes cold damage equal to a roll of your Quarry Die and is knocked back 10 feet in a straight line.
### watery resilience
`15th-LEVEL buccaneer conclave FEATURE`

When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use a reaction to temporarily take on a watery form, halving the damage you would take from the triggering attack.

As part of this reaction, you can also move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
