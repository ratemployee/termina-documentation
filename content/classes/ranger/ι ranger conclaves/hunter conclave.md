> Hunters hold the line between civilization and the wilderness using their deadly tracking and hunting skills. In the shadows of every countryside town lurks a Hunter, silently taking care of any monster that threatens the peace. Hordes of orcs, vile trolls, great and terrible dragons, or great beasts of the wild, it matters not. A Hunter will always overcome their quarry.

### ambuscade
`3rd-LEVEL hunter conclave FEATURE`

You are always prepared to strike first, often getting the jump on your chosen prey. When you roll initiative, so long as you are not surprised, you can use your reaction to take the Hide action, the Attack action, or mark a creature as your Quarry.

If you are surprised, you cannot take this special reaction, but you can act normally on your first turn of combat.
### silent steps
`3rd-LEVEL hunter conclave FEATURE`

You stalk your prey unseen until it is too late. You learn the [[ranger knacks#stalker i|stalker i]] Knack, but it does not count against your Knacks Known. If you know this Knack, you learn another of your choice.
### cunning parry
`7th-LEVEL hunter conclave FEATURE`

Your unyielding focus allows you to parry and counter foes' attacks. When your Quarry targets you with an attack you can see, you can use your reaction to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to your Armor Class against that attack.

If this causes the attack to miss, you can make one weapon attack against your Quarry as part of that same reaction.
### relentless hunter
`7th-LEVEL hunter conclave FEATURE`

You are relentless, stalking your chosen foes until they are all eradicated. When your Quarry is slain, you can mark another creature you can see as your Quarry (no action required) without expending a use of Favored Foe or a spell slot.
### horde breaker
`11th-LEVEL hunter conclave FEATURE`

You are able to cut your chosen prey down as blades of grass. You gain the benefits listed below, each of which can be used as an action on each of your turns. You must be wielding the correct weapon in order to use the corresponding feature:

$\quad$ `volley.` Choose a point you can see within the normal range of a ranged weapon you are wielding. You can make a ranged weapon attack against creatures of your choice within 10 feet of that point. You must have ammunition for each target, and you must make a separate attack roll for each as normal.

$\quad$ `whirlwind.` You make a melee weapon attack against any number of creatures within the reach of a melee weapon you are wielding, making a separate attack roll for each creature.
### ruthless focus
`15th-LEVEL hunter conclave FEATURE`

Your deadly skills rival those of the great hunters of legend and myth. You add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to all weapon attack rolls you make against your Quarry.
