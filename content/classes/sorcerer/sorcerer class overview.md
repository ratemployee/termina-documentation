### sorcerous origin
You are infused with an innate spark of arcane magic. At 1st level, choose one of the following Sorcerous Origins for your power:

- [[aberrant mind]]
- [[astral soul]]
- [[clockwork soul]]
- [[divine right]]
- [[divine soul]]
- [[draconic bloodline]]
- [[emberheart]]
- [[faeblood]]
- [[greensinger]]

- [[ironmonger]]
- [[shadow magic]]
- [[stoneblood]]
- [[stormsoul]]
- [[the chained]]
- [[vampiric soul]]
- [[voidwielder]]
- [[waveborn]]
- [[wild magic]]

Your choice of Origin grants features at 1st level, and again when you reach 6th, 14th, and 18th level in this class.
### sorcery
At 1st level, the spark of arcane magic within you allows you to spontaneously produce spells from within yourself.
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
At 1st level, you learn four cantrips of your choice from the [[sorcerer spell list]]. You learn an additional Sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and again at 10th level.
#### sorcery points
The Sorcerer table shows the number of Sorcery Points that you have to cast the Sorcerer spells you know of 1st-level and higher. To cast a Sorcerer spell, you must expend the amount of Sorcery Points indicated in the table below. You regain all expended Sorcery Points each time you finish a long rest.

For example, as a 3rd-level Sorcerer, you can cast the spell [[burning hands]] at 2nd-level by spending 3 Sorcery Points.

| **Spell Level** | **Point Cost** |
| :-------------: | :------------: |
|     Cantrip     |       0        |
|       1st       |       2        |
|       2nd       |       3        |
|       3rd       |       5        |
|       4th       |       6        |
|       5th       |       7        |
#### spell limit
Your Sorcerer level limits the potency of spells that you can produce. This limit is reflected in the Spell Limit column of the Sorcerer table. For example, as a 5th-level Sorcerer, you are limited to learning and casting spells of 3rd-level or lower.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[sorcerer spell list]]. Refer to the Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table to see when you learn additional Sorcerer spells. Each spell you learn must be of a level equal to your Spell Limit or lower. For instance, when you reach 3rd-level, you can learn one new Sorcerer spell of 1st or 2nd-level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level equal to your Spell Limit or lower.
#### origin spells
Each Sorcerous Origin has a list of Origin Spells that you learn at the Sorcerer levels noted in your Origin's description. Your Origin Spells count as Sorcerer spells for you, but they do not count against your total number of Spells Known.
#### spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells, so you use Charisma when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell, or when you make a spell attack roll for one of your Sorcerer spells.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
#### spellcasting focus
Your body itself can be used as a spellcasting focus. You must have at least one free hand to cast spells that require somatic or material components, and you must still provide material components that are consumed by a spell or have a gold cost.
### font of magic
You have learned to draw upon the innate magic presence in all things to restore your own arcane power. Starting at 3rd level, when you finish a short rest, you can choose to regain expended Sorcery Points equal to your Sorcerer level.

Once you use this feature to regain Sorcery Points, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
### metamagic
At 3rd level, you learn two Metamagic abilities of your choice from the list of [[templates/metamagic|metamagic]]. You can only use one Metamagic ability per spell, reaction, ability check, or saving throw unless its description says otherwise.

As you gain Sorcerer levels, you gain additional Metamagic abilities, as shown in the Metamagics Known column of the Sorcerer table. When you gain a Sorcerer level, you can alter your magical nature and replace one Metamagic ability you know with another Metamagic ability of your choice.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### wellspring
At 10th level, you learn to harness your magic even more effectively. Once per long rest, you can cast one Sorcerer spell of your choice, whether you know it or not. This spell must be equal to your Spell Limit or lower, spending the normal number of Sorcery Points. You can apply your Metamagic abilities to this spell as normal.
### innate arcanum
At 11th level, you manifest an increased level of power from your arcane spark, known as an Innate Arcanum. This takes the form of a single 6th-level spell slot that you can expend, in place of Sorcery Points, to cast any Sorcerer spell you know. Once you expend this spell slot, you do not regain it until you complete a long rest.

Moreover, as a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one Innate Arcanum spell slot to regain a number of your Sorcery Points equal to the level of the Arcanum spell slot.

Finally, whenever you learn a new Sorcerer spell, you can learn spells of a level equal to that of your Innate Arcanums.

When you reach certain Sorcerer levels, your unique magic manifests more powerful Innate Arcanums. At 13th level, you gain a 7th-level spell slot, at 15th level you gain an 8th-level spell slot, and at 17th level, you gain a 9th-level spell slot.
### sorcerous restoration
At 20th level, you realize the full potential of your innate magic, and the weave itself bends to your will and suffuses your entire body. Each Metamagic ability you know has its Sorcery Point cost reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1 Sorcery Point).

Also, you can apply an unlimited number of Metamagic abilities to each spell you cast, provided that you have the Sorcery Points to do so, and the spell you cast meets all the requirements for the Metamagic abilities you wish to apply.
