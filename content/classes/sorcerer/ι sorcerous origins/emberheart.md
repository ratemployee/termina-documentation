This ember of arcane fire fuels your burning soul, inflames your passions, and allows you to perform wondrous and terrible feats of fire magic.

### heart of flame
`1st-LEVEL emberheart FEATURE`

Primordial flame empowers your spirit. You gain resistance to fire damage and you have advantage on any saving throws to resist the charmed and frightened conditions.

You also learn to speak, read, and write Ignan, a dialect of Primordial, and the language of the Elemental Plane of Fire.
### wild fire
`6th-LEVEL emberheart FEATURE`

You can cause fire to erupt from the ruin of your foes. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell that deals fire damage, you can use your reaction to force creatures within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw. They take fire damage based on the size of the creature, as shown in the table below, on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

| **Creature Size** | **Damage** |
| :---------------: | :--------: |
|       Tiny        |     0      |
|       Small       |    1d6     |
|      Medium       |    2d6     |
|       Large       |    3d6     |
|       Huge        |    4d6     |
|    Gargantuan     |    5d6     |
You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses of this reaction when you finish a long rest.
### kindle the flame
`14th-LEVEL emberheart FEATURE`

Your body is restored when you draw on the elemental flame. Whenever you cast a fire spell of 1st-level or higher, you can grant yourself temporary hit points equal to the level the fire spell was cast at + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### primordial inferno
`18th-LEVEL emberheart FEATURE`

Your flaming soul has become an inferno, making you more elemental than mortal. You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep, and you gain immunity to fire damage.

Also, when you take damage from a creature within 60 feet, you can force it to make a Dexterity saving throw as a reaction. On a failure, it takes fire damage equal to your level.
