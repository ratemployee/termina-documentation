> An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?

### telepathic speech
`1st-LEVEL aberrant mind FEATURE`

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1 mile). To understand, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you are incapacitated or die, or if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.
### psionic sorcery
`6th-LEVEL aberrant mind FEATURE`

You learn the [[subtle spell]] Metamagic, but it does not count against your number of Metamagics Known. You can apply Subtle Spell to a Psionic Spell without expending Sorcery Points a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### psychic defenses
`6th-LEVEL aberrant mind FEATURE`

You gain resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
### revelation in flesh
`14th-LEVEL aberrant mind FEATURE`

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 2 or more Sorcery Points to transform your body for 10 minutes. For every 2 Sorcery Points you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:
- You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or shines with an otherworldly light.
- You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. Moreover, gills grow from your neck or fan out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, or you grow writhing cilia that extend through your clothing.
- Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
### warping implosion
`18th-LEVEL aberrant mind FEATURE`

You can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 7 Sorcery Points.
