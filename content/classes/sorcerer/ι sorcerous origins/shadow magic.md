### eyes of the dark
`1st-LEVEL shadow magic FEATURE`

You have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level, when you cast [[darkness]] by spending 2 Sorcery Points, you can see through the darkness you create.
### strength of the grave
`1st-LEVEL shadow magic FEATURE`

Your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
### hound of ill omen
`6th-LEVEL shadow magic FEATURE`

You gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 Sorcery Points to summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the [dire wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16841-dire-wolf)'s statistics, with the following changes:
- The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
- It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your Sorcerer level.
- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.

The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the ground is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.
### shadow magic
`14th-LEVEL shadow magic FEATURE`

You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
### umbral form
`18th-LEVEL shadow magic FEATURE`

You can spend 6 Sorcery Points as a bonus action to transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.
