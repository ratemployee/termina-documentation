> There are many reclusive sages who learn to wield the magic of nature, but a rare few are born with an innate connection to that magic. Known as Greensingers, these wild sorcerers are able to magically manipulate plants, and can even sprout vines from their flesh in order to move about the world. How did you come to bear this primal power? Were you chosen by an ancient forest to serve as its guardian, or are you the child of an ancient prophecy, raised from birth by a Druidic Circle?

### vigorous vines
`1st-LEVEL greensinger FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can extrude (or retract) a thin, yet vigorous, vine from any part of your body up to 10 feet in length. You can use this vine to perform simple tasks, but it can't be used to attack, manipulate tools, or activate items, and it cannot carry more than 10 pounds.

These Vigorous Vines share your Armor Class and have a number of hit points equal to your Sorcerer level. If you extrude a second Vine, the first instantly withers and dies.

As you gain Sorcerer levels, you can extrude more Vines at one time: at 5th level (2), 11th level (3), and 17th level (4).
### grasping growth
`6th-LEVEL greensinger FEATURE`

Your Vigorous Vines can grow up to 15 feet in length. While your vines are extruded, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet of a Vine, making a Charisma (Athletics) check.

Also, while you have at least two Vines extruded, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb on difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
### creeping defense
`14th-LEVEL greensinger FEATURE`

Each of your Vigorous Vines can grow up to 20 feet in length.

In addition, when you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to block the incoming blow with one of your Vines. If the incoming damage would destroy your Vine, you take any damage that would exceed your Vine's remaining hit points.
### sapping grip
`14th-LEVEL greensinger FEATURE`

At the start of your turn, each creature grappled by one of your Vines takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total necrotic damage dealt to all grappled creatures.
### greensong
`18th-LEVEL greensinger FEATURE`

You and the natural world have become one. You can use an action to enter the Greensong, a state of pure harmony with nature. For the next minute, or until you are incapacitated, you gain the benefits listed below:
- You immediately extrude the maximum number of Vines.
- The reach of your Vines temporarily becomes 30 feet.
- When you take the Attack action, you can make an attack, or attempt a grapple with each Vine. You use Charisma for the attack rolls, and they deal magical bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier on a hit.

Once you enter the Greensong, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again. When you have no uses left, you can spend 5 Sorcery Points to use this feature again.
