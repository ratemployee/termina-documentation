> Often born during times of great war and strife, Ironmonger sorcerers have an affinity for all things forged for use in war. They thrive in the midst of battle, wielding potent war magic on the front lines. Ironmongers are formidable foes, and are sought after by captains and conquerors for their ability to turn the tide of any battle, no matter how hopeless.

### armaments of war
`1st-LEVEL ironmonger FEATURE`

The arcane power within your soul grants you an affinity with the armaments of war. You gain proficiency with all light and medium armor, shields, and all simple and martial weapons that lack the heavy or two-handed properties.
### blade of strife
`1st-LEVEL ironmonger FEATURE`

You can conjure up the signature weapon of an Ironmonger sorcerer, the Blade of Strife. As a bonus action, you conjure this mystical Blade at a point you can see within 60 feet. It lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

When you conjure the Blade, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 magical slashing damage. As a bonus action, you can move the Blade up to 30 feet and repeat the attack.

You can conjure this Blade a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. You can only have one Blade at a time, and conjuring a second causes the first Blade to dispel. Finally, if you have no uses of this feature remaining, you can spend 3 Sorcery Points to use it again.
### extra attack
`6th-LEVEL ironmonger FEATURE`

You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your Sorcerer cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

Finally, when your Blade of Strife is within 10 feet of you, you can make attacks with it as part of your Attack action.
### iron smite
`6th-LEVEL ironmonger FEATURE`

Once per turn when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon or Blade of Strife attack, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.
### dancing blade
`14th-LEVEL ironmonger FEATURE`

When a creature within 10 feet of your Blade of Strife is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to add your Charisma modifier to the target's Armor Class against that attack.

Also, your Blade of Strife now deals 2d8 damage on a hit.
### storm of blades
`18th-LEVEL ironmonger FEATURE`

You have become a god of warfare and lay waste to your foes. As an action on your turn, you can destroy your Blade of Strife in a storm of arcane iron shards, forcing two creatures of your choice within 30 feet of the Blade to make a Dexterity saving throw. Targets take 6d8 magical slashing damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful save.

When you use this action, you can spend Sorcery Points to target additional creatures, targeting one additional creature of your choice within 30 feet per Sorcery Point you spend.
