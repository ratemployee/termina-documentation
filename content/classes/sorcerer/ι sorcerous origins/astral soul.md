> Some of the eldest beings left in the multiverse reside in the Astral Plane, the ethereal space between the great planes. Sometimes, if a mortal being is exposed to the luminescent and primordial power of this space between spaces, or one of the ancient creatures that dwells there, they are infected by this magic and transformed into an Astral Soul sorcerer.

### astral ward
`1st-LEVEL astral soul FEATURE`

The primordial power of your bloodline offers you increased protection. At the end of each long rest, you become covered in a faint, shimmering Astral Ward which has a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + twice your Sorcerer level. Whenever you take damage, your Astral Ward takes the damage in your place. If this damage reduces your Astral Ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

Your Astral Ward lasts until the end of your next long rest, at which point it is restored to its full hit points. It is dispelled early if it is reduced to 0 hit points.

Finally, you can use your action to expend Sorcery Points (up to your Spell Limit) to restore the hit points of your Astral Ward by 1d4 for each Sorcery Point you expend.
### pocket dimension
`6th-LEVEL astral soul FEATURE`

You can draw upon your power to shelter allies in your own portion of the Astral Plane. As an action, you can expend 3 Sorcery Points to cast [[rope trick]] with the changes below:
- The extradimensional space is on the Astral Plane.
- The portal to your extradimensional space appears on a flat surface of your choice within 5 feet.
- As an action, you can touch the portal to close (or open) it.
- While the portal is closed, it is hidden from view, and no attacks or spells can pass through the portal. No sound passes through, and creatures cannot see in or out of it.
- At the end of the hour, you can expend 3 Sorcery Points to extend the duration of this effect by 1 additional hour.
### primordial ward
`14th-LEVEL astral soul FEATURE`

The power you are able to draw from your blood rivals that of the titans of the Astral Plane. So long as your Astral Ward has at least 1 hit point, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1), and you are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
### astral regeneration
`18th-LEVEL astral soul FEATURE`

Your magic is restored by time spent in the Astral Plane. The first time you enter your Pocket Dimension created by [[rope trick]], your Astral Ward regains a number of hit points equal to your Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier.

Moreover, whenever you cast a Sorcerer spell that lets you teleport, such as [[misty step]], you can move through the Astral Plane and your Astral Ward regains a number of hit points equal to the level of that spell + your Charisma modifier.
