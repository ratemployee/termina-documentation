### dragon ancestor
`1st-LEVEL draconic bloodline FEATURE`

You choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

### draconic resilience
`1st-LEVEL draconic bloodline FEATURE`

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
### elemental sorcery
`6th-LEVEL draconic bloodline FEATURE`

Whenever you cast a Sorcerer spell that deals the damage type of your Draconic Ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to one damage roll of the spell.

Additionally, you learn the [[elemental spell]] Metamagic, but it doesn't count against your number of Metamagic Known. You can use this Metamagic without expending Sorcery Points, so long as you change its damage to the damage of your Draconic Ancestry.

If you have Amethyst, Crystal, Emerald, or Topaz Draconic Ancestry, you learn [[esoteric spell]] instead.
### dragon wings
`14th-LEVEL draconic bloodline FEATURE`

You gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.
### draconic presence
`18th-LEVEL draconic bloodline FEATURE`

As an action, you can spend 5 Sorcery Points to emanate the aura of a dragon in a 60-foot radius, choosing awe or fear. For the next minute, creatures of your choice that start their turn within the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (awe) or frightened (fear) until the aura ends. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this aura for 24 hours.
