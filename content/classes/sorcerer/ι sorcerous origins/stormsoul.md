### heart of winds
`1st-LEVEL stormsoul FEATURE`

Drawing upon the tempestuous magic within you allows you to take flight. When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, which lasts until the end of your current turn. This flight doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, but if you end your movement while you are in midair you fall to the ground at the end of your turn.

You also learn to speak, read, and write Auran, a dialect of Primordial, and the language of the Elemental Plane of Air.
### stormborn
`6th-LEVEL stormsoul FEATURE`

The tempest within your soul defends you and threatens your foes. You gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage.

As a bonus action, you can expend Sorcery Points (up to your Spell Limit) to force creatures of your choice within 10 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 1d6 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) per Sorcery Point expended on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

Finally, you can use an action on your turn to control the weather in minor ways within a 100-foot radius of you. For example, you could stop the rain, cause it to rain, change the current direction of the wind, or stop the wind completely.
### windcaller
`14th-LEVEL stormsoul FEATURE`

You bend the wind itself to your will. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet, and learn [[wind walk]], which counts as a Sorcerer spell for you, but doesn't count against your Spells Known.

While flying, your lower half becomes a swirling tempest.
### primordial storm
`18th-LEVEL stormsoul FEATURE`

Your tempestuous soul has made you more elemental than mortal. You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep, and you gain immunity to both lightning and thunder damage.

Also, when a creature you can see within 60 feet damages you, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes thunder damage equal to your Sorcerer level and is knocked back 20 feet.
