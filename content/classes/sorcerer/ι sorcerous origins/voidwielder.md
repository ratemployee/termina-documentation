> Before the primordial gods formed the world, there was only the Void. This formless, lightless, writing chaos desires for all creation to return to it. Voidwielders are sorcerers who wield the entropic power of the Void, working to undo the very acts of creation. They are often nihilistic in their outlook on life, resigned to the fact that all will eventually dissolve into the nothingness of the great primordial Void.

### entropic touch
`1st-LEVEL voidwielder FEATURE`

You can channel the power of the Void and send one Tiny or smaller object that you touch into the Void. The item must be nonmagical in nature, and cannot be an object that is being worn or carried by another creature.

It remains in the Void for as long as you concentrate on this ability, as if concentrating on a spell. When you maintain concentration for 1 hour, the object is permanently destroyed. If you break your concentration, the object reappears in an unoccupied space as close as possible to its last location.

You can use this feature once without expending Sorcery Points, and cannot do so again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 3 Sorcery Points to use it again.

The size of the nonmagical item you can target with this feature increases as you gain levels in this class: at 6th level (Medium), 11th level (Large), and 17th level (Huge).
### soul of the void
`1st-LEVEL voidwielder FEATURE`

Your innate connection to the primordial Void grants you the ability to speak, read, and write Primordial.
### negate spell
`6th-LEVEL voidwielder FEATURE`

Your connection to the Void allows you to undo arcane magic. When you cast [[counterspell]] or [[dispel magic]] and you need to make a spellcasting ability check to determine the result, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
### disciple of the void
`14th-LEVEL voidwielder FEATURE`

When you use Entropic Touch, you can send a total number of objects equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1) into the Void at one time. Only one object can be maximum size; the rest must be Small. If you use this ability again, you must choose an object to reappear.
### ray of annihilation
`18th-LEVEL voidwielder FEATURE`

The overwhelming power you draw from the Void allows you to unmake creation itself. You can expend one of your Innate Arcanum spell slots to cast [[disintegrate]] at the same spell level of the Innate Arcanum spell slot you choose to expend.
