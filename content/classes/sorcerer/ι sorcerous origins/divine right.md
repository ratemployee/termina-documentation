> Once in a generation, a divinely chosen ruler is born amongst the people. Some cults and countries seek out these blessed rulers, trusting the gods to select their leader. However, the existence of these chosen sorcerers can pose a significant threat to those currently in power. While some will willingly step aside to let the will of the gods rule, other less honorable leaders will hunt down these challengers to their power.

> As a Divine Right sorcerer, you are granted great power, but with that power also comes responsibility. Will you lead your people to destruction or into a new golden age?
