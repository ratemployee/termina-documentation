> Most mortals who wield the fiendish power of the hells do so through strict contracts with devils and Archdevils. However, some cultists and other mortals connect with more chaotic demonic powers and become Hellspawn. Though not always evil, Hellspawn are fueled by the chaotic magic of the Abyss.

### demonic form
`1st-LEVEL hellspawn FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can unleash your infernal power to transform into a Demonic Form. While you are transformed, your body becomes demonic in appearance, and you gain the benefits listed below for one minute:
- Your hands become wicked natural weapons that deal 1d8 slashing damage on a hit, and you can use your Charisma, in place of Strength, for their attack and damage rolls.
- While you aren't wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.
- As a bonus action, you can grant yourself temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).

Your transformation ends early if you are incapacitated, or you end it as a bonus action. You can transform a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of your Demonic Form transformation left, you can spend 3 Sorcery Points to transform again.

Additionally, you learn to speak, read, and write Abyssal, the language of demons and all creatures of the Abyss.
### extra attack
`6th-LEVEL hellspawn FEATURE`

You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your Sorcerer cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

Finally, while you are in your Demonic Form, your natural weapon attacks count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
### fiendish resistance
`14th-LEVEL hellspawn FEATURE`

Your hellish power can shield you from harm. As a reaction when you take damage while in your Demonic Form, you can expend Sorcery Points to reduce the incoming damage by 2 for each Sorcery Point you expend as part of the reaction.
### archdemonic form
`18th-LEVEL hellspawn FEATURE`

You have mastered the fiendish power that dwells within you. Your Demonic Form lasts until you end it. Also, while you are in Demonic Form, you gain the following additional benefits:
- You can take the Dash action as a bonus action.
- You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
- When you hit a creature with a natural weapon attack, it takes an additional 1d8 magical slashing damage.
