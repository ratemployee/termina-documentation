> Every so often, a mortal catches the attention of a lord or lady of the Fey. Often, the object of affection or offspring of this relationship is gifted wondrous arcane ability beyond that of other mortals. However, these mortal infatuations are usually brief, and the mortals are left to learn to use their power with little supervision or instruction. Whether you were chosen by a powerful Fey, or were the child of such a relationship, you have been blessed with the whimsical power of the Feywild.

### heartsight
`1st-LEVEL faeblood FEATURE`

Your affinity with Fey magic grants you heightened empathic abilities. You gain proficiency in Insight, and you add double your proficiency bonus to your Wisdom (Insight) checks.

In addition, you can use an action to touch a creature and attempt to read its current emotional state. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by its Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you learn the target's alignment and its surface level emotions. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail. Creatures are unaware you attempted to read their heart.
### seasonal attunement
`6th-LEVEL faeblood FEATURE`

You can align your magic and spirit with one of the seasons like a true Fey. At the end of each long rest, choose a season and gain the benefits listed below. Each season grants you a damage resistance and advantage on certain rolls.

| **Season** | **Resistance** | **Roll with Advantage** |
| :--------: | :------------: | :---------------------: |
|   Spring   |   Lightning    |      Hit Die Rolls      |
|   Summer   |      Fire      |    Initiative Rolls     |
|   Autumn   |     Poison     |  Concentration Checks   |
|   Winter   |      Cold      |   Death Saving Throws   |
 ### gateway magic
`14th-LEVEL faeblood FEATURE`

Your magic allows you to slip between the Feywild and the Material Plane. Whenever you cast a Sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher, you can teleport to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet.

When you use this feature, you can spend Sorcery Points to increase its range by 10 feet per Sorcery Point spent.
### intoxicating presence
`18th-LEVEL faeblood FEATURE`

You exude the intoxicating presence of an Archfey. When you cast a Sorcerer enchantment spell and target a creature that is within 15 feet that can see or hear you, the target has disadvantage on its initial saving throw.
