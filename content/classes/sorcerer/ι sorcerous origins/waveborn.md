> Within you dwells a drop of pure elemental water, connecting you to the waters of the deepest oceans, babbling brooks, and frozen lakes. The gentle lapping of waves, the spray of the sea foam on the wind, the crushing darkness of the ocean depths; all of these call to you. Your watery magic can be as refreshing as the rains, or as destructive as great waves and flood waters.

### heart of water
`1st-LEVEL waveborn FEATURE`

The droplet of elemental water within your soul has altered your physical form. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, you can breathe both air and water, and you can see underwater as if you were in bright light.

You also learn to speak, read, and write Aquan, a dialect of Primordial, and a language of the Elemental Plane of Water.
### frozen curse
`1st-LEVEL waveborn FEATURE`

Your watery magic carries a frozen curse. When you deal cold damage with a Sorcerer spell, you can spend additional Sorcery Points to cover targets in frost (1 target per Sorcery Point), reducing their speeds by a number of feet equal to five times your Charisma modifier (minimum: 5 feet).

This reduction to a target's speed lasts until the beginning of your next turn, unless the cursed creature or another creature uses an action to scrape the frost off one of the targets.
### oceanic resilience
`6th-LEVEL waveborn FEATURE`

You are as resilient as water, able to flow and reform. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can flow like water, gaining resistance to any bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing damage from that attack, and can instantly move up to your full speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to use it again.
### watery form
`14th-LEVEL waveborn FEATURE`

Whenever you take the Dash action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to take on a Watery Form until the end of your current turn. While in this Watery Form, you can move through gaps as narrow as 1 inch, including the spaces of enemy creatures, and you gain resistance to damage from opportunity attacks.

In addition, if you are using your swimming speed, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.
### primordial deluge
`18th-LEVEL waveborn FEATURE`

Your watery soul has transformed your physical form, making you more elemental than mortal. You no longer need to drink, eat, or sleep, and you gain immunity to cold damage.

Moreover, you are always considered to be in your Watery Form, unless you choose not to be, and you gain resistance to all bludgeoning, cold, piercing, and slashing damage.

Finally, when you use your Oceanic Resilience reaction, you gain immunity to all instances of bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, and cold damage from the triggering attack.
