> Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

### wild magic surge
`1st-LEVEL wild magic FEATURE`

After you cast a Sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d10. If you roll a number equal to the level at which you cast the spell, immediately make a d100 roll, consulting the Wild Magic Surge table with the DM's assistance to create a random magical effect.

If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case, and the spell lasts for its full duration.
### tides of chaos
`1st-LEVEL wild magic FEATURE`

You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
### bend luck
`6th-LEVEL wild magic FEATURE`

You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 Sorcery Points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.
### wild sorcery
`6th-LEVEL wild magic FEATURE`

You learn the [[unstable spell]] Metamagic, but it does not count against your total number of Metamagics Known. Moreover, for you, it only costs 1 Sorcery Point to use.
### controlled chaos
