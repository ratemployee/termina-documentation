> The dark magic of undeath is a path to great power for those who are willing to pay the price. Many of the most powerful undead creatures will grant their followers a portion of their dark sorcery in return for their service. Evil vampires, long dead mummy lords, and sinister liches have all been known to curse their most loyal followers with sorcerous abilities.

### blood magic
`1st-LEVEL vampiric soul FEATURE`

You have been gifted an affinity for blood magic. Whenever you cast a Sorcerer spell or use a Sorcerer class feature, you can expend your own hit points in place of Sorcery Points by expending two hit points for each Sorcery Point you would have spent. When you do so, your current and maximum hit points are reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This hit point reduction cannot be lessened in any way. Any reduction to your maximum hit points from this feature lasts until the end of your next long rest, at which point it returns to normal.

Moreover, when you slay a creature with a Sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher, you gain temporary hit points equal to the level at which the spell was cast. Any temporary hit points you gain from this feature can be used in place of your current hit points (but not your maximum hit points) for your Blood Magic spellcasting.
### undead resilience
`6th-LEVEL vampiric soul FEATURE`

You gain resistance to both necrotic and poison damage, and you have advantage on saves to resist the poisoned condition.

Also, when you have temporary hit points from your Blood Magic feature, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical, non-silvered attacks.
### misty escape
`14th-LEVEL vampiric soul FEATURE`

As a reaction when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can turn into a cloud of mist, reappearing with 1 hit point in an unoccupied space within 30 feet.

Once you use this reaction, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses left, you can spend 5 Sorcery Points to use this reaction again.
### vampiric mastery
`18th-LEVEL vampiric soul FEATURE`

You have mastered the sinister blood magic within your soul. When you deal necrotic damage to a target with a Sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage.

These temporary hit points can also be used in place of your current hit points for your Blood Magic Spellcasting.
