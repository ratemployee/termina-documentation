> You are a Stoneblood sorcerer, a mortal imbued with a shard of pure elemental earth who can access the powerful magics of rock and stone. Whether this power was given to you by a Dao warlord, the gift of an elder earth elemental, or you are a direct descendant of one of the ancient Dwarven fathers, you now wield the unyielding power of stone. Your magic makes you as rigid and unyielding as the mountains, and can subtly drive you to hoard precious gems and metals of the earth.

### heart of earth
`1st-LEVEL stoneblood FEATURE`

You can use a bonus action on your turn to transform and take on an earthen form, encasing your body in elemental stone. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:
- Upon transforming, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Sorcerer level. Any temporary hit points remaining from this feature dispel at the end of your transformation.
- If you are not wearing any armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier.
- You can use your Constitution, in place of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike.
- Your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If you strike with two hands, the d8 becomes a d10.

Your transformation lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if you are incapacitated or you use a bonus action to end it.

You can transform in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all of your expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of this feature left, you can expend 3 Sorcery Points to transform again.

Finally, you learn to speak, read, and write Terran, one dialect of Primordial and the language of the Elemental Plane of Earth.
### crushing blow
`6th-LEVEL stoneblood FEATURE`

You can empower your strikes with the force of elemental stone. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can expend Sorcery Points (up to your Spell Limit) to deal an additional 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage to the target for each Sorcery Point you spent.

In addition, while you are transformed into your earthen form, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities to nonmagical attacks.
### extra attack
`6th-LEVEL stoneblood FEATURE`

You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast a Sorcerer cantrip you know in place of one of the attacks.
### aegis of stone
`14th-LEVEL stoneblood FEATURE`

You can ward others with elemental earth magic. As a bonus action, you can expend 3 Sorcery Points to ward yourself, or a creature you touch, with an Aegis of Stone for 1 minute. While this Aegis lasts, the creature is resistant to all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

When a creature warded by your Aegis of Stone is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker and make one melee attack against it. You can only teleport in this way if you and the attacker are on the same surface.

Only one creature can benefit from your Aegis of Stone at a time. Warding another creature dispels the previous Aegis.
### primordial bulwark
`18th-LEVEL stoneblood FEATURE`

Your stalwart stone soul has made you more elemental than mortal. You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep, and you are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

In addition, you can have up to three creatures under the effects of your Aegis of Stone at one time.
