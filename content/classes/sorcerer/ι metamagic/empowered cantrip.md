When you cast a Sorcerer cantrip, you can expend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the power of that cantrip to its next level.

For example, a 3rd-level Sorcerer can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast [[fire bolt]] as if they were a 5th-level Sorcerer, and that [[fire bolt]] will deal 2d10 fire damage in place of 1d10.
