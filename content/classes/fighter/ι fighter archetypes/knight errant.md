> Often raised at court or in the upper circles of the nobility, the archetypal Knight Errant is a chivalric warrior of the highest order. They excel at mounted combat and wander the world in search of adventure and opportunities for heroism. These paragons of virtue are bound to defend the weak and weary.

### courtly pedigree
`3rd-level knight errant feature`

You have been tutored in the traditional skills of the nobility and the chivalric virtues. You gain the benefits listed below:
- You learn to speak, read, and write one extra language.
- You gain proficiency in your choice of Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.
- If you are mounted, you cannot be knocked from a trained mount against your will unless you or the mount are incapacitated.
- It only costs you 5 feet of movement to mount or dismount a creature, rather than half of your movement speed.
### chivalric mark
`3rd-level knight errant feature`

You punish any foe who attacks those under your protection. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can Mark it until the end of your next turn. While Marked, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you, so long as you are within 10 feet of it.

If your Mark deals damage to a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against it. As part of this reaction you can expend an Exploit Die to grant yourself advantage on the attack roll, and on hit, you deal bonus damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### noble guardian
`7th-level knight errant feature`

You have trained to defend yourself, your mount, and most importantly, your allies from harm. You gain the Protector Fighting Style, and whenever you use the reaction, you can add one roll of your Exploit Die to the target's Armor Class instead of your normal proficiency bonus. If the triggering attack still hits, you can expend an Exploit Die to grant the target resistance to the damage of the attack.

If you already have the Protector Fighting Style, you gain an additional Fighting Style of your choice.
### unyielding knight
`10th-level knight errant feature`

No one can move past you without your approval. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you whenever they move while within the reach of a weapon you are wielding. Also, whenever you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, its speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of its next turn.

Finally, you can use the [[skilled rider|skilled rider]] Exploit at will without expending an Exploit Die.
### perilous charge
`15th-level knight errant feature`

You run down your foes, mounted or on foot. Once per turn, when you move 10 feet in a straight line then hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If you are mounted, the creature has disadvantage on this saving throw.
### legendary knight errant
`18th-level knight errant feature`

You will defend your allies against any foe. You gain a special reaction that you can take once during every turn, but you can only use this special reaction for an opportunity attack or your Protector Fighting Style reaction.

Moreover, if you are riding a trained mount and it takes damage, you can choose to take that damage in its place.
