> Though they have been known by many names over the ages, Ronin are fighters who have been expelled from the service of their original lord or land. Regardless of the reason, these highly skilled warriors now roam the wild seeking absolution through battle. With nothing left to lose, these warriors fight with a deadly ferocity and ruthless focus unlike any other.

### exiled courtier
`3rd-level ronin feature`

You were once an influential member of a noble court or an important advisor. You learn to speak, read, and write one additional language of your choice and gain proficiency in either History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.
### unyielding spirit
`3rd-level ronin feature`

You fight with the unrivaled focus and ruthless ferocity of a warrior with nothing left to lose. As a bonus action, you can focus yourself to gain advantage on all weapon attack rolls and ignore any levels of exhaustion you have until the end of your current turn. When you use this bonus action, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Fighter level.

Once you use this bonus action to focus yourself, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses remaining, you can use this feature again, but you gain one level of exhaustion at the end of that turn.
### lordly bearing
`7th-level ronin feature`

Your experience and former station shine through no matter how downtrodden you may become. Whenever you make an ability check with your skill gained from Exiled Courtier, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

You also gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you are already proficient in Wisdom saving throws, you instead gain proficiency in Charisma or Intelligence saving throws.
### unrelenting
`10th-level ronin feature`

You are able to push through adversity that would defeat a lesser warrior. When you roll initiative with no uses of your Unyielding Spirit feature remaining, you regain one use.

Moreover, whenever you use your Second Wind feature, your current level of exhaustion, if any, is reduced by 1.
### swift strikes
`15th-level ronin feature`

You rain blows down upon foes like raindrops in a storm. Once per turn when you have advantage on a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can forgo your advantage to make one additional weapon attack against that creature.
### legendary ronin
`18th-level ronin feature`

Your battle focus is so absolute that you can avoid the grasp of death itself, if only for a short time. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can immediately take an extra turn.

During this extra turn, you remain at 0 hit points, and any damage you take causes you death saving throw failures as normal.

At the end of this extra turn, you immediately fall to the ground unconscious with 0 hit points, and if you gained three death saving throw failures during that turn, you die.

Once you use this feature you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a use of Action Surge to use this feature again.
