> Before the mortal races rose to power, it is said that the world was ruled by giants and their powerful Rune magic. Traces of this ancient magic can still be found in the wild and remote places of the world, and fighters who learn to use the power of Runes to augment combat ability become known as Runecarvers.

### rune carving
`3rd-level runecarver feature`

You have learned the ancient art of carving Runes. You learn to speak, read, and write Giant, the language of your Runes, and you gain proficiency with calligrapher's supplies. Your knowledge of Runes also grants you the benefits below:
#### runes known
You learn two Runes of your choice from the list at the end of this Archetype. Some Runes have a Fighter level prerequisite, which you can learn as soon as you reach that Fighter level.

You learn one additional Rune of your choice when you reach 7th, 10th, 15th, 18th level in this class.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Runes you know with another Rune of your choice.
#### inscribing a rune
Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use your calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a Rune you know into a weapon, suit of armor, or another object you can wear or hold. While wearing or wielding that object, you gain the benefits of that Rune.

Each Rune can only be inscribed in one object. Inscribing it into another object dispels any previous inscriptions.
#### invoking a rune
While you are wearing or wielding an object inscribed with a Rune, you can invoke its effect. Once invoked, a Rune cannot be invoked again until you complete a short or long rest. Only you can invoke your Runes.
#### runic exploits
Any Exploits you learn from your Runes do not count against your number of Exploits Known, and you can use them at will without expending an Exploit Die.
#### saving throws
If a Rune requires a creature to make a saving throw, it does so against your Exploit save DC.
### runic might
`3rd-level runecarver feature`

As a bonus action, you can empower your body with Runic Might, granting you the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You and anything you are wearing grows to become Large in size, so long as there is room for you to grow.
- Once per turn when you make a Strength-based ability check, saving throw, or a weapon damage roll, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

You can empower yourself in this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### runic ward
`7th-level runecarver feature`

You can shield your allies with the stalwart magic of Runes. When a target you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to add your Constitution modifier (minimum: +1) to its Armor Class against that attack.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### unyielding
`10th-level runecarver feature`

The elder magic of the giants has caused physical changes. You have advantage on saving throws to resist being moved against your will, knocked prone, poisoned, or stunned.
### ancient insight
`15th-level runecarver feature`

Your understanding of the ancient magic of Runes has grown deeper. When you have no uses of a Rune remaining you can expend one Exploit Die to invoke that Rune again.
### legendary rune carver
`18th-level runecarver feature`

When you use Runic Might, you can become Huge, so long as there is room for you to grow. While Huge, your reach increases by 5 feet.
