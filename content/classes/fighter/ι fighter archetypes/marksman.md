> While all fighters learn to draw a bow or hurl a javelin, those known as Marksmen are masters of ranged combat. The deadly skill of a Marksman are often backed up by their signature swagger and unshakable confidence. When combined, there are few challenges that a true Marksman cannot overcome.

### elite training
`3rd-level marksman feature`

Your training has enhanced your reaction times. When you make a Dexterity check or saving throw, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can do so after you roll, but before you know the result.
### marksman's focus
`3rd-level marksman feature`

You can quiet your body to fire with deadly accuracy. When you begin your turn and are not surprised or incapacitated, you can choose to enter a state of Focus, which imposes the following benefits and effects until the end of your turn:
- Your speed is reduced to 0 feet.
- Until you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you have advantage on all ranged weapon attack rolls.
- When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a ranged weapon, you can reroll the die. You must use this new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
### cunning shot
`7th-level marksman feature`

Your reflexes are almost supernaturally fast. You add your proficiency bonus to your Initiative rolls while conscious.

You have also learned to identify and exploit even the smallest weak points in your enemy's defenses. Your attacks with ranged weapons ignore resistance to piercing damage.
### reposition
`10th-level marksman feature`

When you use Second Wind, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and any opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage until the end of your current turn.
### reliable shot
`15th-level marksman feature`

You make even impossible shots with ease. Your normal and long range for ranged weapon attacks increases by a number of feet equal to 10 times your Fighter level.

Also, once per turn, when you have advantage on a ranged weapon attack, you can forgo advantage and make one additional ranged weapon attack.
### legendary marksman
`18th-level marksman feature`

Your marksmanship is supernaturally accurate. When you Focus, the benefits last for 1 minute, and you have advantage on all ranged weapon attacks for the duration. Finally, your speed is only reduced to 10 feet. At the start of your turn, you can end your Focus (no action required).
