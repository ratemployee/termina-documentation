### down to earth
`3rd-level quartermaster feature`

You gain proficiency with cook's utensils, land vehicles, and Animal Handling, and whenever you make an ability check that uses one of these three proficiencies, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### rations
`3rd-level quartermaster feature`

You are able to prepare potent morsels of food that keep your allies in peak condition. At the end of a long rest, you can use cook's utensils to prepare a number of Rations equal to your Constitution modifier from the list at the end of this subclass.

As a bonus action, you can eat a prepared Ration, or feed a Ration to a creature within 5 feet. Consuming a Ration ends any current Ration effects on that creature. Any Rations you have prepared become inert at the end of your next long rest.

As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to prepare an additional Ration of your choice, though you don't regain that Exploit Die until that Ration is eaten. You can eat a Ration or feed it to a creature as part of the action used to create it. 
### dependable
`7th-level quartermaster feature`

You are always there to lend a helping hand to your allies. You can take the following special actions as a bonus action:

$\quad$ `administer.` You feed a potion, Ration, or consumable item to a willing or unconscious creature within 5 feet of you.

$\quad$ `arm.` You give a weapon, item, or any ammunition you are carrying to a creature within 5 feet. The creature can then equip the given item, and stow one item as a free action.

$\quad$ `encourage.` You take the Help action, targeting a creature of your choice within 10 feet that can see or hear you.

$\quad$ `wrangle.` You make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) or a land vehicles check to control a mount or cart you are riding.
### quick ration
`10th-level quartermaster feature`

You have greatly improved the speed at which you prepare Rations. You can use a bonus action on your turn to create a Ration of your choice, eating it or feeding it to a creature within 5 feet of you as part of that same bonus action. Any Rations created in this way expire after 1 minute.

You can create a Quick Ration a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### ever ready
`15th-level quartermaster feature`

You are always ready to support your companions. When you roll initiative, so long as you are not surprised, you prepare one Ration of your choice without expending an Exploit Die.
### legendary quartermaster
`18th-level quartermaster feature`

Your experiments with Rations have toughened your body. Your Constitution score, and maximum Constitution score, increase by 2, and you gain immunity to the poisoned condition.

In addition, you are always under the effects of one Ration of your choice with a duration of at least 1 minute. You can change the Ration effect at the end of each short or long rest.

## rations
Below are the Rations available to Quartermaster Fighters. If a Ration has a Fighter level prerequisite, you can prepare the Ration at the same time you meet the prerequisite level.

A creature can only be under the effect of one Ration at a time, eating another Ration ends any previous Ration effects.
### 3rd-level rations
#### fortifying ration
`duration: 1 minute`

Upon consumption, the creature chooses either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. For the duration, the creature can add your Constitution modifier (minimum: +1) to any ability check or saving throws it makes with the chosen ability score.

At 10th level, the duration of the effect increases to 1 hour.
#### invigorating ration

Upon consumption, the creature regains hit points equal to 1d10 + your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1).

At 10th level, this Ration can also cure the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions.
#### stimulating ration
`duration: instantaneous`

This Ration must be consumed as part of a short rest. Upon consumption, the creature gains advantage on its rolls for all Hit Dice it chooses to expend during that short rest.

At 10th level, consuming this Ration allows the creature to treat any Hit Dice it expends during that short rest as the maximum possible result instead of rolling.
### 5th-level rations
#### limbering ration
`duration: 1 minute`

Upon consumption, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet.

At 10th level, in place of increasing the creature's speed, the creature can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

At 10th level, the duration of the effect becomes 1 hour.
#### heightening ration
`duration: 1 minute`

Upon consumption, the creature chooses either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. For the duration, the creature can add your Constitution modifier (minimum: +1) to any ability check or saving throw it makes with the chosen ability score.

At 10th level, the duration of the effect increases to 1 hour.
#### warding ration
`duration: 1 minute`

### 10th-level rations
#### tenacious ration

Upon consumption, the creature gains immunity to one of the following conditions (its choice): blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned.

At 15th level, this Ration grants a creature immunity to two of the conditions from the list above (its choice).
### 15th-level rations
#### berserker ration
`duration: 1 hour`

Upon consumption, the creature does not fall unconscious when it is reduced to 0 hit points. However, it still makes death saving throws as normal, dying upon failing three.
#### rejuvenating ration
`duration: instantaneous`

Upon consumption, the creature gains all the benefits of a short rest, including the ability to expend its Hit Dice as part of consuming the Ration. At the end of its current turn, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion.

After a creature eats this Ration, it must finish a long rest before it can gain the benefits of any other Rations.
