> Of all the creatures that serve great dragons, only their most loyal and skilled lieutenants are granted a portion of draconic power. Known as Drakesworn, these elite fighters wield the elemental power of their draconic lords to great effect on the field of battle. These most trusted agents of elder wyrms are second in might and authority only to the dragon they serve.
