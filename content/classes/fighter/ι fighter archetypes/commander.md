> Not all fighters rely solely on themselves in battleâ€”some lead others with their knowledge of tactics. Commanders lead at the front, issuing orders and inspiring greatness in others by their own brave deeds. By their presence, a Commander can transform an unorganized militia into a deadly fighting force.
