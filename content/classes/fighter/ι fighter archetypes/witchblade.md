> Those who walk the dark path of the Witchblade are driven by an overwhelming desire to destroy the great evils of the world. Those especially dedicated, those willing to give up anything, are often approached by Eldritch Powers, beings of otherworldly might. These benefactors offer power in return for a fraction of the warrior's soul or unquestioning fealty.

### pact magic
`3rd-level witchblade feature`

The bargain you have struck with your Patron has granted you the ability to cast spells, much like a Warlock does:
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[mystic spell list]]. Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you learn one additional Witchblade cantrip of your choice.
#### spell slots
The Witchblade Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of your Witchblade spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[mystic spell list]]. The Spells Known column of the Witchblade Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.

When you gain a level, you can choose a Witchblade spell you know and replace it with another Witchblade spell, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Witchblade spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### sanguine offering
`3rd-level witchblade feature`

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one of your Fighter Hit Dice as part of the attack to deal an additional 1d10 necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the normal damage of your weapon.
### otherworldly step
`7th-level witchblade feature`

You can use Eldritch power to slip through cracks in reality. When you use Second Wind, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you appear within 5 feet of a creature, you can make one weapon attack against it.
### enchanted strikes
`10th-level witchblade feature`

The Eldritch magic within your blood seeps into your weapon strikes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it has disadvantage on the first saving throw you force it to make against a Witchblade spell before the end of your next turn.
### greater offering
`15th-level witchblade feature`

You can restore your own vitality by inflicting pain on others. When you use Sanguine Offering, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt to the creature. Temporary hit points you gain from this feature last for 1 minute, or until you gain temporary hit points again.
### legendary witchblade
`18th-level witchblade feature`

You siphon power from death. As a reaction when a creature dies within 30 feet of you, you can regain one expended Pact Magic spell slot, or 1d4 of your expended Hit Dice.

Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
