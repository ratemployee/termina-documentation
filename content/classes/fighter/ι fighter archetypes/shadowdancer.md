### conjure shade
`3rd-level shadowdancer feature`

As a bonus action, you can draw on the umbral power of the Shadowfell to conjure a Shade in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet. This Shade is a magical copy of you created from shadow that uses the Shade stat block below. Though it resembles you, it has no personality of its own.

The Shade shares your turn in combat, but it cannot act on its own. You can telepathically command it to move up to its speed on your turn, but if the Shade is more than 30 feet away from you at the end of your turn, it is instantly destroyed.

Whenever you take the Attack action, you can choose for each individual attack to originate for you, or your Shade. If you attack from your Shade, you make the attack as if you were in its space, with all of your benefits to that attack.

Your Shade lasts until it is destroyed, or you use your bonus action to dismiss it, or you conjure another Shade.

> #### SHADE
> `Undead (your size), unaligned`
> 
> **Armor Class**$\quad$ 14 + your Charisma modifier
> **Hit Points**$\quad$ 1
> **Speed**$\quad$ 30 ft.
> <hr>
> 
> **Condition Immunities**$\quad$ All conditions
> **Languages**$\quad$ Your Shade understands all the languages you know, but it cannot speak itself.
> 
> <hr>
> 
> ##### TRAITS
> `dark bond.` If your Shade is forced to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll.
> 
> `incorporeal echo.` The Shade has no physical presence and counts as difficult terrain for creatures that move through its space. It cannot hold or interact with any objects, nor can it attune to or use any magic items.
> 
> `umbral guardian.` When a creature would provoke an opportunity attack from your Shade, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in your Shade's space.
### dance of shadows
`3rd-level shadowdancer feature`

You and your Shade dance about in a blur of shadow. If your Shade is within 30 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to switch places with it without provoking opportunity attacks.
### shade strike
`7th-level shadowdancer feature`

Your connection to shadow magic has grown, empowering your Shades. Immediately after you use Dance of Shadows, you can make a single weapon attack from either you or the space of your Shade, as part to of the same bonus action.

You can make this bonus attack a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend an Exploit Die as part of Dance of Shadows to make this bonus attack again.
### umbral voyage
`7th-level shadowdancer feature`

As an action, you can experience the world through your Shade's senses. When you do so, you are blind and deaf to your own surroundings, but your Shade can move up to 1 mile away from you without being instantly destroyed.

This effect lasts for 10 minutes, but it ends early if your Shade is destroyed, or you use your bonus action to end it.
### dark sacrifice
`10th-level shadowdancer feature`

When a creature within 10 feet of your Shade is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to cause your Shade to intercept the attack, reducing the damage that the target would take by an amount equal to your Fighter level and causing your Shade to take the damage in its place.
### restorative shadows
`15th-level shadowdancer feature`

You can draw some of the power of your destroyed Shades back to you. If your Shade is destroyed by damage, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Charisma modifier.
### legendary shadowdancer
`18th-level shadowdancer feature`

Your command over the shadow magic you use is unrivaled. Whenever you conjure a Shade, you can choose to conjure two Shades, without expending any additional resources.
