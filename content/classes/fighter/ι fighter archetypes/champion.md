### mighty warrior
`3rd-level champion feature`

Your raw physical might enhances your attacks. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

At 15th level, your critical hit range increases again, and you score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 on the d20.
### remarkable strength
`3rd-level champion feature`

You easily perform feats of raw strength and endurance that would seem impossible. Whenever you make a Strength or Constitution ability check or saving throw, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### peak athlete
`7th-level champion feature`

Your physical abilities are peerless. You gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and when you use your Second Wind, you gain the benefits of the Dash action.
### devastating critical
`10th-level champion feature`

Whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can deal additional damage equal to your Fighter level.

At 15th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can maximize the damage instead of rolling. Once you do, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
### legendary champion
`18th-level champion feature`

You are a nearly perfect physical specimen and have become exceedingly hard to kill. If you begin your turn with less than half of your hit points remaining, but at least 1 hit point, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier.
