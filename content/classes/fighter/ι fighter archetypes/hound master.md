> Since the dawn of civilization, animals have worked alongside mortals. Most notable of the domesticated animals is the dog. The earliest hunters worked in tandem with these loyal beasts, sharing both food and fire. Some fighters still take up this mantle, training loyal hounds to adventure by their side.

### loyal hound
`3rd-level hound master feature`

When you adopt this archetype, you complete the training of a Loyal Hound. Your Hound is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It uses the Loyal Hound stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) and Exploit save DC.

In combat, your Hound acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another action. Also, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks to order your Hound to make a Bite or Maul attack. If you are incapacitated, your Hound can act on its own and it will defend both you and itself to the best of its abilities.

If your Hound is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. Should it die, your skills allow you to find a canine-like creature and train it as a Loyal Hound over the course of a long rest, at which point, that creature uses the Loyal Hound stat block.

### iron jaws
`7th-level hound master feature`

Your Loyal Hound is infused with a portion of your fighting spirit. The damage of your Hound's Bite and Maul attacks counts as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities to nonmagical attacks and damage.

In addition, any creature that is at least one size smaller than your Hound has disadvantage on its Strength saving throw to resist being grappled by your Hound's Bite attack.
### steadfast companion
`10th-level hound master feature`

You can face any foe so long as your Hound is by your side. Your Hound has advantage on any saving throw it is forced to make so long as it is within 30 feet and can see or hear you.

Also, whenever you use Second Wind, your Loyal Hound also regains hit points equal to 1d10 + your Fighter level so long as it is within 30 feet and can see or hear you.
### canine fury
`15th-level hound master feature`

Your commands inspire wild fury. When you use a bonus action to command your Hound to make an attack, it can make two Maul attacks, or one Maul and one Bite attack.
### hound of legend
`18th-level hound master feature`

Thanks to your training, your Hound has come to rival the great beasts of legend. When you use Action Surge, your Hound also gains one extra action on that turn.

Moreover, your Hound's Strength and Dexterity scores each become 18, thereby increasing the bonus to hit and damage of both its Bite and Maul attacks by +2 each.
