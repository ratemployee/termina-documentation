> No matter the mission, a Guerrilla will execute it with utmost perfection. Sometimes known as commandos, these warriors are marked by their determination and adaptability. Whether harsh terrain, vicious monsters, enemy soldiers, or powerful spellcasters, nothing short of death will cause the willpower of a Guerrilla warrior to waver in the pursuit of their goals.
