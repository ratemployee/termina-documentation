> Many warriors swear Oaths to gods of battle and war, but not all are blessed with the divine power of paladins or clerics. Those who fight for the gods without their explicit blessing are called Crusaders. These zealots are champions of divine causes, their fervent belief fueling their battle fury.

### crusader's ire
`3rd-level crusader feature`

You mark your foes for divine judgment. As a bonus action, you can Mark a creature within 60 feet as the target of your Crusader's Ire, granting you the following benefits:
- Once per turn when you miss the creature with a weapon attack, you can immediately make another weapon attack against that creature using the same weapon.
- When the creature is within your reach and casts a spell or makes an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack.
- When it forces you to make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

Your Mark lasts for 1 minute, or until the creature is slain. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses remaining, you can expend an Exploit Die to use this feature again.
### fanatical discipline
`3rd-level crusader feature`

You gain proficiency in Religion, and whenever you make an Intelligence (Religion) check related to your god or cause, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### renewed fervor
`7th-level crusader feature`

Your fanaticism grants you burst of fervor in battle. When you use your Second Wind, you regain the use of Crusader's Ire.

In addition, when you Mark a creature as the target of your Crusader's Ire, you can move up to 30 feet toward it as part of the same bonus action without expending your movement.
### zealous fury
`10th-level crusader feature`

Your conviction allows you to survive blows that would slay those of lesser faith. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead and immediately make one weapon attack against your attacker.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can use it again, but you instantly gain a level of exhaustion.
### righteous judgment
`15th-level crusader feature`

You are the arbiter of divine wrath. When you hit the target of Crusader's Ire with a weapon attack, you can end the Mark to cause your attack to deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

If the attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, you instantly regain the use of Crusader's Ire.
### legendary crusader
`18th-level crusader feature`

When the target of Crusader's Ire targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against that creature. If you use this reaction after the attack hits you, your weapon attack is made with advantage.
