> Where most fighters look to increase their physical abilities, those known as Mystics work to unlock the psionic potential of their mind. Drawing upon wondrous inner power, these ascetic warriors can perform feats that would be impossible through strength alone. Where others strive for physical victory in battle, Mystics strive for spiritual enlightenment

### psionics
`3rd-level mystic feature`

You have unlocked the true potential of your mind, and have learned to manifest psionic spells.
#### psi points
The potential of your mind is represented by a pool of Psi Points. The Mystic Psionics table shows how many Psi Points you have to manifest your spells of 1st-level and higher. To manifest a spell, you expend Psi Points equal to the spell's level (0 for cantrips). You regain all expended Psi Points when you finish a short or long rest.
#### mental limit
Your Fighter level limits the potency of spells you can psionically manifest. This limit is reflected in the Mental Limit column of the Mystic Psionics Table.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[mystic spell list]]. The Spells Known column of the Mystic Psionics table shows when you learn more Psion spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level equal to your Mental Limit or lower.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can choose one of the Psion spells you know and replace it with a Psion spell of your choice, of a level equal to your Mental Limit or lower.
#### spellcasting focus
Your mind itself is your spellcasting focus for your Psion spells. You must have at least one free hand to cast spells with somatic or material components, and you must provide material components that are consumed by the spell or have a required gold cost. When you manifest a spell with your psionics, you exhibit noticeable changes.
#### spellcasting ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Psion spells. You use Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a Psion spell you know.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### minor telekinesis
`3rd-level mystic feature`

You can move objects with pure psionic power. You learn the [[mage hand]] cantrip, and when you manifest it, you do not need to provide the verbal or somatic components. Your [[mage hand]] is invisible, and can lift a number of pounds equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 10 pounds).
### mystic empowerment
`3rd-level mystic feature`

You enhance your techniques with psionic power. When an Exploit would use your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can choose to use your Intelligence instead.

Also, once per turn when you damage a creature with a Martial Exploit you know, you can choose for the Exploit to deal psychic damage in place of its normal damage type.
### phase step
`7th-level mystic feature`

When you use Second Wind, you also gain the benefits of the Dash action and partially discorporate. Until the end of your current turn, you can move through solid nonmagical objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain.

If you end your movement inside an object or creature, you are instantly shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are forced to move.
### inscrutable mind
`10th-level mystic feature`

The vast power of your mind makes you difficult for others to dominate. You have advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed, frightened, or having your thoughts read.

Also, whenever you succeed on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can spend 1 Psi Point to force the attacker to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage equal to your Fighter level.
### psionic ward
`15th-level mystic feature`

You can project pure psionic power to defend allied minds. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 Psi Points to project a Psionic Ward, which emanates out from you in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. You, and creatures of your choice within range, gain resistance to psychic damage and can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum: +1) to any Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws that you are forced to make.
### legendary mystic
`18th-level mystic feature`

You have unlocked the full potential of your mind. You learn the [[telekinesis]] spell, but it doesn't count against your total number of Spells Known. You can manifest this spell once, without expending any Psi Points.

Once you manifest [[telekinesis]] in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can manifest it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend 5 Psi Points to manifest this spell again.

Finally, when you use Phase Step, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of that turn.
