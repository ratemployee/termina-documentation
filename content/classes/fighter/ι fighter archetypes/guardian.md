> Guardians are elite defensive warriors whose strengths shine while fighting side by side with their allies. Though trained to use weapons of all types, Guardians are especially effective when using a protective style of fighting with a weapon and shield. Alone, a Guardian is a small threat, but when fighting alongside their allies, they are impenetrable walls of steel.

### guardian stance
`3rd-level guardian feature`

So long as you are wielding a shield, you can use a bonus action to enter a Guardian Stance that lasts indefinitely. It ends if you are incapacitated, you doff your shield, or you end it as a free action. It imposes the following effects:
- Your speed is reduced by 10 feet.
- Both you and creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class.
- As a reaction when a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can become the target of that attack, taking the damage if the attack would hit you.
- You can make a Shove attack as a bonus action.
### warrior smith
`3rd-level guardian feature`

You gain proficiency in leatherworker's and smith's tools.

Over the course of 1 hour, you can use these tools to reinforce a shield or set of armor you touch, granting it a +1 Armor Class bonus until the end of your next long rest.
### rallying wind
`7th-level guardian feature`

You inspire others to stand their ground. When you use Second Wind while in your Guardian Stance, creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you that can see or hear you gain temporary hit points equal to your Fighter level.
### stalwart defender
`10th-level guardian feature`

You are strongest when standing side by side, and shield by shield, with your allies. You gain the following benefits:
- You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class for each allied creature within 5 feet that isn't incapacitated.
- You cannot be moved against your will or knocked prone while you are in your Guardian Stance.
- You and allied creatures within 5 feet have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws while you are in your Guardian Stance.
- When you roll initiative, you can instantly enter your Guardian Stance as long as you are not surprised.
### improved stance
`15th-level guardian feature`

You improve your defensive techniques to better defend those who stand beside you. The range of your Guardian Stance, and all its features, now extends to creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you. Moreover, your Guardian Stance grants creatures half cover, in place of the +1 bonus to Armor Class.
### legendary guardian
`18th-level guardian feature`

You are a master Guardian and a near-supernatural shield to defend the weak. The range of your Guardian Stance and its features include creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you.
