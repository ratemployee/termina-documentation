> Arcane Knights supplement their skill with the armaments of war with arcane knowledge. Compared to mages who study only magic, Arcane Knights can only produce minor spells, but, when combined with their deadly skill with the weapons of warfare, these minor spells become potent enhancements.

### weapon bond
`3rd-level arcane knight feature`

You can magically bond yourself to a weapon of your choice. At the end of a short or long rest, you can touch a weapon, forging a magical bond between you and that weapon.

You cannot be disarmed of a bonded weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can use a bonus action to instantly summon it to you. It can be used as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane Knight spells.

You can have up to two bonded weapons at any one time, though they must be summoned one at a time. If you bond a third weapon, you break the bond with one of the other two.
### spellcasting
`3rd-level arcane knight feature`

You have learned to produce arcane spells to enhance your abilities in combat. You gain the features listed below:
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[arcane knight spell list]], and you learn an additional Arcane Knight cantrip at 10th level.
#### spell slots
The Arcane Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [[shield]] and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast [[shield]] using either slot.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You know three 1st-level Arcane Knight spells. The Spells Known column of your Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher, of a level for which you have spell slots.

When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the [[arcane knight spell list]]. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcane Knight spells. You use Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for an Arcane Knight spell.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

When you use Action Surge, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can choose to teleport before or after the additional action from your Action Surge.
### legendary arcane knight
`18th-level arcane knight feature`

You expertly weave spell and sword together. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast an Arcane Knight spell with a casting time of one action in place of one attack.
