### second wind
You can fight on where lesser warriors would fail. Also at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Fighter level. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

Upon reaching 14th level, you can use your Second Wind bonus action twice between short or long rests.
### martial exploits
At 2nd level, you begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the features below:
#### exploit dice
The Fighter table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform any Exploits you know. Most Exploits require you to expend these Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Exploit Dice begins as d6s and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Fighter table.
#### exploits known
You learn two [[martial exploits]]. The Exploits Known column of the Fighter table shows when you learn additional Exploits. To learn an Exploit, you must meet any prerequisites that it may have, like a minimum ability score or Fighter level.

Each time you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of the Martial Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice, so long as you meet that Exploit's prerequisites.
#### saving throws
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

$\quad$ **Exploit save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
### know your enemy
Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. You learn if it is your equal, superior, or inferior in one of the following attributes:
- Armor Class
- Current Hit Points
- Hit Point Maximum
- Walking Speed
- Strength Score
- Dexterity Score
- Constitution Score
- Exploits Known

Once you use this feature to learn something about a creature, you can't use it on it again until you complete a short or long rest.

When you reach 14th level, you can use this feature to learn of your foe's strengths through battle. Once per turn, you can use this feature when you hit with a weapon attack. You can use this feature to learn three things about a creature between each short or long rest.
### martial archetype
At 3rd level, you choose one of the following Martial Archetypes that best represents the skills and training of your fighter:

- [[arcane knight]]
- [[champion]]
- [[commander]]
- [[crusader]]
- [[drakesworn]]
- [[guardian]]
- [[guerrilla]]
- [[hound master]]
- [[knight errant]]
- [[marksman]]
- [[mystic]]
- [[pugilist]]
- [[quartermaster]]
- [[ronin]]
- [[runecarver]]
- [[shadowdancer]]
- [[sylvan archer]]
- [[witchblade]]

The Martial Archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
##### archetype exploits
Some Archetypes have a list of Archetype Exploits that you learn at the Fighter levels noted in the Archetype description. They don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched out for other Exploits. If you do not meet an Archetype Exploit's prerequisites, you learn it regardless.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### extra attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

When you reach certain levels in this class, the number of attacks you can make as part of your Attack action increases; at 11th level (3 attacks) and at 17th level (4 attacks).
### action surge
Starting at 6th level, you can push yourself past your limits, if only for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on that current turn. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

When you reach 20th level, you can use this feature twice between each short or long rest, but only once per turn.
### indomitable
Your fighting spirit allows you to grasp success from the jaws of defeat. Beginning at 9th level, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. 

At certain Fighter levels, you can use this feature additional times between each long rest. You can use this feature twice starting at 13th level, and three times starting at 17th level.
### martial superiority
Your martial skill eclipses even that of professional warriors. Starting at 11th level, whenever you use your Second Wind feature, you regain one of your expended Exploit Dice.

Also, you regain all Expended Exploit dice if you spend 10 minutes doing only activity that would be part of a short rest.
### relentless
At 20th level, your skills in combat are those of legend. When you roll initiative, you regain all expended Exploit Dice.

Also, if you start your turn with no Exploit Dice remaining, you immediately regain one of your expended Exploit Dice.
