### magical tinkering
At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and the new property applies.

==You can affect larger objects with this feature as you gain levels in this class: at 6th level (Medium or smaller), 10th level (Large or smaller), 14th level (Huge or smaller), and 20th level (Gargantuan or smaller).==
### spellcasting
You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.
#### tools required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the [[artificer spell list]]. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.
#### preparing and casting spells
The artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [[artificer spell list]]. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum: one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [[cure wounds]], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
#### spellcasting ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
#### ritual casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
### infuse item
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.
#### infusions known
When you gain this feature, pick ==two== Infusions of your choice from the list of [[artificer infusions]]. The Infusions Known column of the artificer table shows when you learn more Infusions of your choice.

==At the end of a long rest, as long as you have tinker's tools, you can replace one Infusion you know with another Infusion of your choice, so long as you meet all of its prerequisites.==
#### infusing an item
==At the end of a long rest, you can use your tinker's tools to imbue an Infusion you know into a nonmagical object. To do so, you must be able to touch the object with your tools.==

==If the Infusion requires attunement, you can attune to the object the instant you infuse it, or you can forgo the attunement so another creature can attune to it. To attune to the infused item later, you must follow the normal attunement process.==

The Infusion remains in an item indefinitely. If you die, the Infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1 day). Infusions vanish immediately if you give up your knowledge of one to learn another ==or imbue the Infusion into another object.==

You can infuse multiple objects at the end of each long rest, ==up to one for each Infusion you know.== Each Infusion can be in only one object at a time, and no object can bear more than one Infusion. If you transfer an Infusion to a new object, any previous instance of that Infusion immediately ends.
#### replicate magic item
==You can also use your Infusions to replicate magic items that you have studied. Over the course of a long rest, you can use tinker's tools to examine a magic item you can touch. At the end of that long rest, you can replace one of your Infusions Known with the knowledge of this magic item. After which, you can infuse an object with the properties of that magic item, following all the rules for the other Infusions.==

==You can use this feature to replicate any item of Common rarity. As you gain levels in this class, you can use this feature to replicate items of increasing rarity: at 5th level (Uncommon), 11th level (Rare), and finally at 17th level (Very Rare).==
### artificer specialist
Artificers pursue many disciplines. At 3rd level, choose one of the following specializations that best represent the arcane research and inventions of your artificer:

- [[aeronaut]]
- [[alchemist]]
- [[archivist]]
- [[armorer]]
- [[battle smith]]
- [[biomancer]]
- [[chronothief]]
- [[machinist]]
- [[wandslinger]]

Your choice of specialization grants features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 5th, 9th, and 15th level in this class.
### the right tool for the job
At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### adjustable infusions
==Beginning at 6th level, you can alter your Infusions on the fly. Over the course of a short rest, you can use tinker's tools to replace one of your Infusions Known with another Infusion of your choice or to learn to replicate one magic item you can touch. At the end of the short rest, you can imbue your new Infusion in an object you touch. If it requires attunement, you can follow the normal rules for attuning to your Infusions.==

==Once you replace one of your Infusions Known in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.==
### tool expertise
There are few who can match an artificer's innate talent with their tools of choice. Starting at 6th level, whenever you make an ability check that uses a tool with which you are proficient, you can add double your proficiency bonus to your roll.
### flash of genius
Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### magic item adept
When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

- You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
- If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.
### spell-storing item
At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the [[artificer spell list]] that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum: twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.
### magic item savant
At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:

- You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
- You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.
### magic item master
Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.
### soul of artifice
You imbue a spark of your own essence in the magic items you bear. At 20th level, you gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws for each magic item you are attuned to. In addition, if you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to end your attunement to one magic item or Infusion, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

==Moreover, if you are killed, any object that bears one of your Infusions counts as part of your body for the purposes of any spell that would bring you back to life.==
