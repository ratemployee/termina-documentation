> Alchemy is a delicate art—tip the ratio of ingredients too far out of line and the effects could be disastrous. Those that study the magic of arcane potions and brews are known as alchemists. They are experts at combining exotic reagents to produce a variety of materials and effects. From healing droughts that can mend a wound in moments to sticky goo that explodes when it comes in contact with open flame. With careful preparation, and a bit of luck, alchemists are masters of both giving life and leeching it away.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL alchemist specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you are already proficient with alchemist's supplies, you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.
### alchemical elixirs
`3RD-LEVEL alchemist specialist FEATURE`

At the end of each long rest, you can use your alchemist's supplies produce an Elixir in an empty flask you touch. At creation, you choose the Elixir's effect from the table below, some of which include your proficiency bonus (PB). The effect of an Elixir is triggered when someone drinks the Elixir. As a bonus action, a creature can drink the Elixir or administer it to a creature within 5 feet. A creature can only be under the effects of one Elixir at a time, and drinking another immediately ends any other Elixir effects. 

Any Elixir you create through this feature lasts until it is consumed, or until the end of your next long rest. 

As an action on your turn, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to create an Elixir in an empty flask you touch. You can use the Elixir as part of the same action. At certain levels in this class, you can make more Elixirs at the end of a long rest: at 6th level (two), and 15th level (three).

| Resilience | The drinker gains a bonus to their Armor Class equal to half your PB for 10 minutes.                                              |

### alchemical savant
`5th-LEVEL alchemist specialist FEATURE`

When you cast an artificer spell that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, or restores hit points, you gain a bonus to the damage, or healing, roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: +1).
### restorative reagents
`9th-LEVEL alchemist specialist FEATURE`

Whenever a creature drinks one of your Elixirs, they gain temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier, in addition to the Elixir's effect. 

Also, you can cast [[restoration]] at its base level without expending a spell slot, even if you don't have it prepared, provided you use your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can cast [[restoration]] in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### master alchemist
`15th-LEVEL alchemist specialist FEATURE`

You have become a master among Alchemist artificers. You gain resistance to acid and poison damage, and immunity to the poisoned condition. 

In addition, you can cast both [[restoration]] (at 5th-level) and [[heal]] without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use your alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus. 

You can cast each of these spells once with this feature, and you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
