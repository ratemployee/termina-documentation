> Armies require protection, and someone has to put things back together if defenses fail. A combination  of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert at defending others and repairing both material and personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are usually accompanied by a steel defender, a protective companion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle Smith and a steel defender.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with smith’s tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.
### battle ready
`3RD-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You have trained to stand alongside your Steel Defender in battle. You can use your Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls you make with magic weapons, or any weapon that bears one of your Infusions.
### steel defender
`3RD-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You have created for yourself a faithful construct, known as a Steel Defender. It is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your orders. Your Steel Defender's game statistics are found in the Steel Defender stat block on the following page, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in multiple places.

In combat, your Steel Defender acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only uses the Dodge action on its turn unless you use your bonus action to order it to take an action in its stat block, or another action. If you are incapacitated, your Steel Defender acts on its own.

If your Steel Defender has died within the last hour, you can touch it with your smith's tools and expend an artificer spell slot to return it to life with its maximum hit points.

At the end of a long rest, you can magically create a new Steel Defender with your smith's tools. When you do so, any previous Steel Defenders are immediately rendered inert. Upon its creation, you choose the shape of your Steel Defender, which can affect its abilities in and out of combat:

$\quad$ `Humanoid.` Your Steel Defender is the size of a Medium humanoid creature. It is proficient with shields, and it has humanoid hands that it can use to perform basic tasks.

$\quad$ `Quadruped.` Your Steel Defender resembles a Large beast of your choice. Its speed increases by 10 feet, and it can be ridden as a trained mount as if it was a trained mount, only by its creator.

### infusion bearer
`5th-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You design your Steel Defender to bear your most potent Infusions. Your Steel Defender can bear any Infusion that is meant for boots, cloaks, gauntlets, helms, or suits of armor. However, it can only bear one Infusion at a time.
### minor upgrade
`5th-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You improve the offensive capabilities of your Steel Defender. Choose one of the Minor Upgrades below: 

$\quad$ `Minor Arcanum.` You imbue your Steel Defender with a 1st-level artificer spell with a casting time of one action. As a bonus action, you can order your Steel Defender to cast the imbued spell at 1st-level, using your spellcasting modifier. Your Steel Defender has a number of charges of the spell equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1), and it regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest. 

$\quad$ `Martial Offense.` The damage of your Steel Defender's Rend becomes 1d10, and when you command it to take the Rend action it can make two Rend attacks instead of one. It can replace either Rend attack with a grapple or shove.
### adjustable upgrades
`9th-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You learn to adjust your Steel Defender's Upgrades to face the challenges at hand. Each time you finish a long rest, you can use your smith's tools to replace one of your Steel Defender's Upgrades with another Upgrade gained at the same level.
### greater upgrade
`9th-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You can imbue your Steel Defender with wondrous abilities and features. Choose one of the Greater Upgrades below: 

$\quad$ `Limited Sentience.` You improve the cognitive abilities of your Steel Defender. Its Intelligence score becomes a 10. It also gains proficiency with a set of tools of your choice and learns to speak, read, and write two languages of your choice. 

$\quad$ `Modular Construction.` Your Steel Defender can bear up to two Infusions, though the Infusions must be meant for different types of objects. For example, your Steel Defender could be infused with an Infusion meant for a suit of armor and an Infusion meant for a helm, but not two Infusions that are both meant to be used on suits of armor. 

$\quad$ `Reinforced Plating.` You improve the structure of your Steel Defender. It gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from all non-magical attacks.
### masterwork upgrade
`15th-LEVEL battle smith specialist FEATURE`

You imbue your Steel Defender with wondrous abilities and powers. Choose one of the Masterwork Upgrades below: 

$\quad$ `Arcane Ward.` Creatures of your choice within 15 feet of your Steel Defender are resistant to damage from spells. 

$\quad$ `Self-Destruct.` You embed a powerful arcane explosive in your Steel Defender. As a bonus action, you can order your Steel Defender to self-destruct, destroying itself and forcing creatures within 20 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take force damage equal to your Steel Defenders remaining Hit Dice on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Once this feature is used, your Steel Defender cannot be revived until the end of your next long rest. 

$\quad$ `Major Arcanum.` You imbue your Steel Defender with a 3rd-level artificer spell with a casting time of one action. As a bonus action, you can order your Steel Defender to cast the imbued spell at 3rd-level, using your spellcasting modifier. Your Steel Defender has a number of charges of the spell equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1), and it regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.
