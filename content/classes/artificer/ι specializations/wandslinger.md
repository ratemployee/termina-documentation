> Wandslingers use their ingenuity and artistic minds to craft wondrous arcane weapons. What they lack in flexibility and subtlety, they make up for in overwhelming arcane firepower. Wandslingers are marked by their signature Arcane Sidearm. For some, these are intricately carved wands or staffs, and for others, they are expertly crafted runic iron cannons.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL WANDSLINGER specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you are already proficient with woodcarver's tools, you instead gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.
### arcane sidearm
`3RD-LEVEL WANDSLINGER specialist FEATURE`

You construct for yourself a Wandslinger's signature weapon. At the end of a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to craft an Arcane Sidearm. It resembles a Tiny object of your choosing, though its appearance has no effect on its abilities. Many Wandslingers craft Sidearms that resemble delicate wands, ornate rods, or even eldritch cannons. 

Your Arcane Sidearm is a simple weapon with the ranged (120/300) property, and you use your Intelligence, instead of your Dexterity, for its attack and damage rolls. On hit, it deals force damage equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier. 

Your Arcane Sidearm can be used as a spellcasting focus by you. You can only have one Arcane Sidearm at a time. Creating another Arcane Sidearm renders that magic of the first inert.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can use your Arcane Sidearm to use one of the abilities listed below. If one of these abilities forces a creature to make a saving throw, it does so against your spell save DC.

$\quad$ `Shocking Burst.` Your Arcane Sidearm conjures a burst of lightning at a point you can see within 60 feet, forcing creatures within 5 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 2d6 lightning damage on a failure, and half as much damage on a success

$\quad$ `Thunderous Blast.` Your Arcane Sidearm emits a blast of magic in an adjacent 15-foot cone. Any creatures in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage. Any Large or smaller creature that fails this saving throw is also knocked back 10 feet away from you in a straight line.

$\quad$ `Wandslinger's Ward.` Your Arcane Sidearm produces a field that grants you, or a creature of your choice within 10 feet of you, temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1 temporary hit point).
### spell slinger
`5TH-LEVEL WANDSLINGER specialist FEATURE`

You wield your Arcane Sidearm with deadly skill. When you use your action to make an attack with your Arcane Sidearm, you can make two attacks instead of just one. These attacks can target two targets or the same target. 

As you gain levels in this class, the number of Arcane Sidearm attacks you make as part of a single action increases: at 11th level (3), and 17th level (4).

In addition, you have honed your reflexes so that you can nearly always strike first. When you roll initiative and are not surprised or incapacitated, you can use your reaction to make one attack with your Arcane Sidearm, or another magic wand, rod, or staff that you are holding, before any other creatures act.
### expert duelist
`9TH-LEVEL WANDSLINGER specialist FEATURE`

The amount of lightning or thunder damage dealt or temporary hit points granted by your Arcane Duelist actions increases by 1d6.
### master wandslinger
`15TH-LEVEL WANDSLINGER specialist FEATURE`

You become a master of Wandslinger artifice. You gain the benefits listed below:

- When you use your action to make an Arcane Sidearm attack, you can cast an artificer spell that normally requires an action to cast as a bonus action.
- When you cast an artificer spell and use your Arcane Sidearm as the spellcasting focus, you can choose for that spell to deal force damage in place of its normal damage type.
- As a reaction when you, or a creature within 10 feet of you, is targeted by a spell, you can grant all creatures within 10 feet of you three-quarters cover against the triggering spell.
- You can choose for your Arcane Duelist bonus actions to deal force damage in place of their normal damage type.
