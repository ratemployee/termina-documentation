> While most artificers are content with mechanical innovation, some see biology, the science of living things, as an area rife with potential. Biomancers are those who use their talents to supplement their own anatomy and create life. Combining necromancy and transmutation magic, Biomancers see all living things as prototypes that can be magically evolved.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL BIOMANCER specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with leatherworker's tools. If you are already proficient with leatherworker's tools, you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.
### aberrant chimera
`3RD-LEVEL BIOMANCER specialist FEATURE`

You can use your understanding of biomancy to create an aberrant life form. whenever you cast [[find familiar]], you instead create a Chimera, which functions as a normal familiar, but has the following changes:
- The material component is 1 pound of organic matter.
- It is a monstrosity (instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend).
- It has additional hit points equal to your artificer level.
- As an action, the Chimera can touch a creature and sacrifice any amount of its hit points, healing the target for the same amount by grafting its flesh to others.

As an action, the Chimera can merge with a creature it can touch, granting it temporary hit points equal to the Chimera's remaining hit points. While merged, the target gains one of the Chimeric Traits below. The creatures remain merged until you create another Chimera or the temporary hit points are depleted, at which point the Chimera is destroyed.

$\quad$ `Amphibious Physiology.` While merged, the creature can breathe both air and water, and gains a 30 foot swim speed. 

$\quad$ `Resilient Hide.` While merged and not wearing any armor or using a shield, the creature's Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier + their Constitution modifier. 

$\quad$ `Vestigial Limb.` While merged, the creature grows an additional limb which resembles their own limbs. It has a reach of 5 feet, and can lift a number of pounds equal to your Intelligence score. The limb can't use weapons or shields nor can it do anything that requires manual precision.
### augmented flesh
`5TH-LEVEL BIOMANCER specialist FEATURE`

The power of your Chimera is enhanced when it is merged with its master. You gain the following benefits while you are merged with your Aberrant Chimera:
- Whenever you make an attack or damage roll, ability check, or saving throw that would normally use your Strength, you can use your Intelligence score instead.
- You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without making an ability check.
- As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to grant yourself temporary hit points equal to five times the level of the spell slot + your Intelligence modifier. These temporary hit points are added to any temporary hit points you have from merging with your Aberrant Chimera.
### extra attack
`5TH-LEVEL BIOMANCER specialist FEATURE`

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
### strange evolution
`9TH-LEVEL BIOMANCER specialist FEATURE`

You have enhanced your own physiology with strange magic. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, and you permanently gain one Chimeric Trait of your choice. 

When you reach 15th level in this class, you gain a second permanent Chimeric Trait of your choice (for a total of two).
### master biomancer
`15TH-LEVEL BIOMANCER specialist FEATURE`

You have become a master of Biomancer artifice. When you target a creature with a spell from your Biomancer Spells feature, you can grant a single target (additional) temporary hit points equal to your artificer level.

In addition, when merged with your Chimera, you are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
