#artificersubclass

> [!quote|badge] 
> For those that pursue the magic of artifice, no area of study is too dangerous. Perhaps against their better judgment, some artificers choose to experiment with Chronomancy, the magic of time. Known as Chronothieves, these bold artificers are marked by their signature Chronometers, a wondrous object which they use to steal moments and adjust the flow of time.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL CHRONOTHIEF specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with jeweler's tools. If you are already proficient with jeweler's tools, you instead gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.
### chronometer
`3RD-LEVEL CHRONOTHIEF specialist FEATURE`

You can create a Chronometer, marking you as a true Chronothief. At the end of a long rest, you can use your jeweler's tools to construct a Tiny timekeeping device, like a watch, hourglass, or small sun dial, which can be used as a spellcasting focus by you for your artificer spells.

You can only have one Chronometer at a time, and creating another causes the magic within the first to dissipate. 

Your Chronometer has a number of charges equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. It regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest. While your Chronometer is in hand, you can expend a charge to use the following abilities: 

$\quad$ `Accelerate.` As an action, you increase the speed of a creature within 60 feet by a number feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier until the end of their next turn. 

$\quad$ `Decelerate.` As an action, you force a creature that within 60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, its movement speed is reduced by a number feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier until the end of its next turn. 

$\quad$ `Slip.` As a reaction when a creature within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can force them to re-roll. You must use this reaction before you know if the triggering attack, check, or saving throw succeed. 

$\quad$ `Warp.` As an action, you can switch places with a creature within 60 feet, each instantly teleporting to the other's space. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be forced to switch places with you.
### stolen moments
`5TH-LEVEL CHRONOTHIEF specialist FEATURE`

You have improved your Chronometer so that you can literally save moments in time for later. When you successfully paralyze, stun, or reduce a creature's movement speed to 0 with a spell or Chronothief ability, your Chronometer regains one of its expended charges. 

Also, any of your Chronometer abilities that require an action to use can also be used as a bonus action on your turn.
### empowered chronomancy
`9TH-LEVEL CHRONOTHIEF specialist FEATURE`

Your understanding and control over the magic of time has greatly increased. The magic of your Chronometer improves in the following ways: 

$\quad$ `Accelerate.` Opportunity attacks against the target creature have disadvantage until the end of their next turn. 

$\quad$ `Decelerate.` You can spend an additional charge to double the movement speed reduction. If this feature reduces a target's speed to 0, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. 

$\quad$ `Slip.` You can spend two charges to use this reaction after you know if the triggering attack roll, ability check, or saving throw succeeded or failed. 

$\quad$ `Warp.` You can spend additional charges to increase the range by an additional 30 feet for each charge you expend.
### master chronothief
`15TH-LEVEL CHRONOTHIEF specialist FEATURE`

You are a master of Chronothief artifice. You can overload your Chronometer, expending any remaining charges, to cast [[time stop]].

Once you cast [[time stop]] in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
