> While some artificers spend their lives perfecting one solitary creation. Machinist artificers value quantity over quality. They are known for creating their signature Automatons, small clockwork men that are created for a single—albeit temporary—purpose. Armed with their tools and an army of strange and wondrous servants, machinists are ready for any challenge.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL MACHINIST specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already proficient with smith's tools, you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.
### automatons
`3RD-LEVEL MACHINIST specialist FEATURE`

You learn to craft Automatons. At the end of each long rest, you use your smith's tools to magically create a Small Automaton in an unoccupied space within 5 feet. Once you create an Automaton, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to create another one. You can have one Automaton at a time—creating a second causes the first to fall apart.

Automatons are magical constructs with an Armor Class equal to 12 + your Intelligence modifier, and hit points equal to your artificer level + your Intelligence modifier. When they make an ability check or a saving throw, its ability scores are 10 (+0). If [[mending]] is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour.

When you create your Automaton, you decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the table below. As a bonus action on your turn, you can activate the Automaton if you are within 60 feet. As part that bonus action, you can direct the Automaton to walk up to 25 feet to an unoccupied space.
#### automaton model
| **Model** | **Activation**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   Agent   | You can see and hear through the senses of your Automaton, so long as you are within 100 feet. You are deaf and blind to your senses until you end this link as a bonus action |
|  Anchor   | The Automaton latches onto a creature within 5 feet, reducing the target's movement speed by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 5 feet).   |
|   Armor   | The Automaton attaches itself to a willing creature within 5 feet. While attached, the creature's Armor Class cannot be less than 13 + your Intelligence modifier.             |
|  Artisan  | The Automaton gains proficiency in one set of tools, and adds your Intelligence modifier to any check it makes using that set of tools.                                        |
|  Assault  | The Automaton makes a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet. On hit, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.                      |
### arcane conduit
`5TH-LEVEL MACHINIST specialist FEATURE`

You learn to channel magic through your Automatons. When you cast an artificer spell, you can choose for the spell to originate from an Automaton, instead of yourself, so long as you are within 60 feet of it. 

When you cast a spell in this way, you roll a d8, and add the number rolled to one damage, or healing, roll of the spell.
### automated army
`3RD-LEVEL MACHINIST specialist FEATURE`

You can create and control Automatons even more efficiently. You can control up to two Automatons at one time, and at the end of each long rest you can create two Automatons of your choice, without expending a spell slot. You can activate all Automatons as one bonus action
### efficient production
`9TH-LEVEL MACHINIST specialist FEATURE`

When you expend an artificer spell slot to create an Automaton, you create a number of Automatons equal to the level of the spell slot expended. You cannot use this feature to exceed your maximum number of Automatons.
### master machinist
`15TH-LEVEL MACHINIST specialist FEATURE`

You have become a master of Machinist artifice. You can control up to three Automatons at one time, and at the end of a long rest, you create three Automatons of your choice, without expending a spell slot.

Also, when you are forced to make a saving throw or are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to switch places with one of your Automatons that is within 60 feet of you. The Automaton then becomes the target of the attack or saving throw.
