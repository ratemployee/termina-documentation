> For centuries, chroniclers have sought the best way to store vast amounts of information. Where most are satisfied with scrolls, Archivists strove for something greater. They have learned to store libraries worth of information in a single object, awakening the first Artificial Minds. Working in tandem with these wondrous Minds, Archivists wield the potentially limitless power of these arcane intelligences.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL archivist specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with calligrapher's supplies. If you are already proficient with calligrapher's supplies, you instead gain proficiency with another type of artisan's tools of your choice.
### artificial mind
`3RD-LEVEL archivist specialist FEATURE`

You learn to awaken Artificial Minds within objects. At the end of a long rest, you can touch a Tiny, non-magical object, and use your calligrapher's supplies to awaken an Artificial Mind within it. While the Artificial Mind is awakened within an object, it is considered a magic item that requires attunement, and it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. If you attempt to rouse a Second Artificial Mind while you already have one from this feature, the first Artificial Mind ceases to exist. While attuned to your Artificial Mind, you gain the following abilities:

$\quad$ `Information Overload.` You can cause your Artificial Mind to overload the minds of your foes by channeling information at them. As an action, you can force a creature that you can see within 30 feet to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage and disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.

The damage of Information Overload increases as you gain levels in this class: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

$\quad$ `Magical Telephony.` You can communicate telepathically with any creature carrying one of your infused items while they are within a 1 mile radius. The creature can respond telepathically.

$\quad$ `Skill Proficiencies.` You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from the column on the Artificial Mind table. The material of the object determines the skills you choose from, as the object's nature affects the mind's knowledge.

| **Material** |       **Examples**        |             **Skill Proficiencies**              |
| :----------: | :-----------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|    Animal    | parchment, leather, bone  |  Animal Handling, Insight, Perception, Survival  |
|   Mineral    | gems, glass, metal, stone | Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion |
|    Plant     |  paper, wood, vegetable   |        Arcana, History, Nature, Religion         |
### acute overload
`5th-LEVEL archivist specialist FEATURE`

You can expend a spell slot to increase the psychic damage of Information Overload. The damage increases by 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, and an additional 1d8 for each spell level above 1st-level.

Also, when you deal psychic damage using your Artificial Mind as a spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus: +1).
### improved consciousness
`9th-LEVEL archivist specialist FEATURE`

The cognitive abilities of your Artificial Mind are powerful enough to aid your spellcasting. When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus: +1).
### master archivist
`15th-LEVEL archivist specialist FEATURE`

You are a master of Archivist artifice. You can use an action on your turn to transform into pure information and teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet, or an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a creature or object bearing one of your artificer Infusions.
