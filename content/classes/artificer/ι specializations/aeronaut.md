> One of the most dangerous obsessions an artificer can pursue is that of flight. Many strive for this lofty goal, and all but the most dedicated—and foolhardy—artificers fail in their pursuits. Experiments that end in disastrous explosions, catastrophic falls from the sky, and deadly malfunctions are not out of the norm for an Aeronaut perfecting their mechanical flying machine.

### tools of the trade
`3RD-LEVEL aeronaut specialist FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you are already proficient with woodcarver's tools, you gain proficiency with another type of artisan's tools of your choice.
### flying machine
`3RD-LEVEL aeronaut specialist FEATURE`

At the end of a long rest, you can use your woodcarver's tools to construct a Flying Machine. You choose the Machine's appearance, but it has no effect on its abilities. Your Flying Machine has the following features:
- It can be used as a spellcasting focus by you.
- It is built to fit you, and can be worn over light armor.
- When you fall, and aren't incapacitated, you subtract up to 100 feet from your fall when calculating falling damage, and can move 2 feet horizontally every 1 foot you fall. 
- You gain a flying speed of 15 feet, which increases as you gain levels in this class: at 5th level (20 feet), 9th level (30 feet), and finally at 15th level (60 feet). 
- When you make a weapon attack while at least 5 feet off the ground, you can use your Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

You can only have one Flying Machine at a time, and creating another causes the other to fall into disrepair.
### extra attack
`5th-LEVEL aeronaut specialist FEATURE`

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
### aerial maneuvers
`9th-LEVEL aeronaut specialist FEATURE`

While wearing your Flying Machine, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. 

In addition, while you have your Flying Machine equipped, you gain a bonus to your Dexterity ability checks and saving throws equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus: +1).
### master aeronaut
`15th-LEVEL aeronaut specialist FEATURE`

You have become a master of Aeronaut artifice. While wearing your Flying Machine, if you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed, and only half damage if you fail.
