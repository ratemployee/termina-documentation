> Oathless are paladins who abandon their divinely appointed Sacred Oath for reasons other than evil, but still retain some of their power. They wander as lost warriors, often becoming bandits or mercenaries. Some quest for a purpose, looking to renew their Oath, but many of the Oathless fall into dispair.

> Across all peoples and cultures, those who break Oaths, especially paladins, are viewed with distrust. In cultures that place a high value on honor, Oathless are met with violence.

#### oathless spells
You learn certain spells at Paladin levels as noted in the table below. They don't count against your total number of Spells Known and cannot be switched upon gaining a level.

| **Paladin Level** | **Spells**                                  |
| :---------------: | ------------------------------------------- |
|        3rd        | [[charm person]], [[false life]]            |
|        5th        | [[invisibility]], [[suggestion]]            |

|       17th        | [[dominate person]], [[passwall]]           |
#### shattered oath
The shattered power of your broken Oath radiates from you. Whenever you make an ability check to convince any creature to trust you or to enter into a deal or agreement of any kind, you subtract your Paladin level from your roll. This effect can manifest in many ways, causing creatures to distrust you.
### treacherous mark
`3rd-LEVEL oathless FEATURE`

You have no qualms fighting without honor or ignoring the rules of war. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack and there is another hostile creature within 5 feet of your target, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to mark it.

Whenever you damage this marked target with a weapon attack, including the attack used to mark it, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to your damage roll.
### draining smite
`3rd-LEVEL oathless FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse this strike with your self-serving power. The bonus damage of this Divine Smite becomes necrotic, and you gain temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.
### illusory escape
`3rd-LEVEL oathless FEATURE`

Your fervent devotion to yourself above all else allows you to escape harm. When you take damage from a source you can see, you can use your reaction to expend 1 Divine Fervor, become invisible, and move up to your speed. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn, or until you attack or force a creature to make a saving throw.
### aura of deception
`7th-LEVEL oathless FEATURE`

You have no qualms securing your safety at the expense of others. When you use Illusory Escape, you can force a creature of your choice within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|Aura of Protection]] to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you and the creature instantly switch places, and it takes the triggering damage in your place. You then gain the normal benefits of Illusory Escape starting from the space that you reappear in.
### forceful will
`15th-LEVEL oathless FEATURE`

You use your presence to dominate instead of aiding others. When you force a creature within your Aura of Protection to make a saving throw to resist the effects of an enchantment spell, it has disadvantage on its initial saving throw.
### avatar of dishonor
`20th-LEVEL oathless FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can focus your self-serving power to become a gray shade of the righteous Paladin you could have been, gaining the following benefits for the next minute:
- You become invisible as if by the [[greater invisibility]] spell.
- You can take the Dash or Hide action as a bonus action.
- When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can force it to repeat its attack against another creature of your choice within the normal range of that attack.

This transformation ends early if you become unconscious or you use a bonus action to end it. Once you transform, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. If you have no uses, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
