> Where most paladins swear their Oath to a divine cause or ideal, some swear an Oath to themselves, vowing to awaken their inner power. Known as Mystics, these paladins spend years in secluded places, unlocking the wondrous psionic power that lies dormant deep within their minds.

#### oath of mysticism tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of Mysticism uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `asceticism.` In order to draw out your full potential, you must forgo all attachments.

$\quad$ `enlightenment.` Strive to realize your full potential. Help others discover their true selves.

$\quad$ `knowledge.` Knowledge is the only treasure that can bring deeper enlightenment.

### enlightened magic
`3rd-LEVEL oath of mysticism FEATURE`

When you cast one of your Mysticism Spells, you can grasp your holy symbol and expend 1 Divine Fervor to cast it without its verbal or somatic components.
### psionic smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of mysticism FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with the raw power of your mind. The damage of the attack becomes psychic, and until the beginning of your next turn, the creature's speed is halved and it cannot take reactions.
### mystic defense
`3rd-LEVEL oath of mysticism FEATURE`

Your mind is nearly as resilient as the armor you wear. Whenever you make an Intelligence or Wisdom ability check or saving throw, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1).
### aura of enlightenment
`7th-LEVEL oath of mysticism FEATURE`

The wondrous psionic power of your mind can shield your allies from hostile mental effects. Creatures of your choice under your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] gain resistance to psychic damage and have advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed or frightened.
### psionic rebuke
`15th-LEVEL oath of mysticism FEATURE`

Your mind protects you when physical defenses fail. When a creature in your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] hits you with an attack, it takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1), so long as you are not incapacitated.
### avatar of mysticism
`20th-LEVEL oath of mysticism FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can briefly unleash the full power of your psionic abilities to take on a luminous form, granting you the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You become translucent and emit otherworldly bright light, in a 5-foot radius, and dim light 5 feet beyond that.
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You gain immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your movement inside another object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you were forced to travel.
  
Once you transform, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
