> Known as white knights, paladins that swear this Sacred Oath are paragons of virtue, honor, and justice. Holding themselves to the highest standards of goodness and law, they idolize the celestial angels as the perfect model. Paladins of Devotion are beacons of light in a dark world.

#### oath of devotion tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of Devotion uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `compassion.` Help and protect the vulnerable. Show mercy to your enemies, but temper your mercy with caution.

$\quad$ `honesty.` Do not deceive others for your benefit. Always follow through on your word.

$\quad$ `honor.` Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. Obey those with rightful authority.

### righteous smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of devotion FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with holy power. After the damage of the attack, your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you for 1 minute and must use its turns to move as far from you as it possibly can. The effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Fiends, undead, and other creatures of evil alignment have disadvantage on this Wisdom saving throw.
### devote mind
`3rd-LEVEL oath of devotion FEATURE`

When you cast a paladin spell that requires concentration, you can expend Divine Fervor equal to the spell's level to devote your mind to the service of good rather than on the spell. When you do so, the spell no longer requires concentration, instead lasting for the duration.
### greater good
`3rd-LEVEL oath of devotion FEATURE`

You can hold yourself to the highest of standards: self-sacrifice. As an action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor, present your holy symbol, and draw on a number of hit points from your [[paladin class overview#lay on hands|lay on hands]] pool. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains that number of hit points and you take an equal amount of necrotic damage.
### aura of care
`7th-LEVEL oath of devotion FEATURE`

You emit an aura of care while you aren't incapacitated. When you any any creatures of your choice within the range of your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] roll a die or dice to regain hit points, the creature gains a bonus to one roll equal to your Charisma modifier.
### cleansing presence
`15th-LEVEL oath of devotion FEATURE`

When you use your Lay on Hands, you can expend 15 hit points from your [[paladin class overview#lay on hands|lay on hands]] pool to cure the target of one condition or reduce one level of exhaustion affecting it. You can cure multiple conditions and neutralize multiple levels of exhaustion with a single use of [[paladin class overview#lay on hands|lay on hands]], expending hit points separately for each one.
### avatar of devotion
`20th-LEVEL oath of devotion FEATURE`

You can assume a form of angelic idealism as an action, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.
- Your [[paladin class overview#lay on hands|lay on hands]] pool regains 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns.
- You have resistance to necrotic damage.
- You can use your [[paladin class overview#lay on hands|lay on hands]] as a bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
