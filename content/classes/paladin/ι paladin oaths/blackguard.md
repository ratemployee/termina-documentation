> Paladins who swear this dark vow devote themselves fully to the advance of evil. Whether they are in league with powerful fiends and undead or work alone. Blackguards are known for their cruelty, hatred of all things beautiful, and willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone to achieve their sinister goals. Blackguard Paladins are always of an evil alignment, and acting otherwise is the same as violating their Sacred Oath.

### dark apostle
`3rd-LEVEL blackguard FEATURE`

You learn to speak, read, and write either Abyssal or Infernal, and you have advantage on Charisma checks to interact with fiends, undead, and other creatures of extraplanar evil.

Also, when you hit a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### dreadful smite
`3rd-LEVEL blackguard FEATURE`

When you use Divine Smite, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse this strike with your hatred. After the damage of the attack, your target and creatures of your choice within 30 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are frightened of you for 1 minute. However, if a frightened target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can repeat this Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
### marshal of darkness
`3rd-LEVEL blackguard FEATURE`

As an action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and focus your will at one fiend or undead you can see within 30 feet, forcing it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this feature on another target.

This feature has no effect on fiends and undead who have a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than your Paladin level.
### aura of hate
`7th-LEVEL blackguard FEATURE`

Your hatred for all things beautiful and good empowers the forces of darkness. Any fiend or undead under your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|Aura of Protection]] can add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to any melee spell or weapon damage roll it makes.
### sinister resilience
`15th-LEVEL blackguard FEATURE`

You have become so suffused with dark power that you have begun to resemble the sinister creatures of the lower planes. You gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

You also no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and for every 10 years that pass you only age 1 year. However, you now count as an undead in addition to your creature type.
### avatar of hate
`20th-LEVEL blackguard FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can transform into an avatar of divine hatred. While transformed you gain the following benefits: 
- Any bright light within 30 feet of you becomes dim light.
- When you deal necrotic damage to a creature you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
- When a creature frightened of you starts its turn within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|Aura of Protection]], it takes 4d10 necrotic damage.
- As a bonus action, you can force one creature within your Aura of Protection to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 necrotic damage.

This transformation ends early if you become unconscious or you end it as a bonus action. Once you use transform, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to use this transformation again.
