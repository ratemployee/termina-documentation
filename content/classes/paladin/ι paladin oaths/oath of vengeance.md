> Known as avengers or dark knights, paladins who swear this Oath often do so out of a desire for revenge. Whether they wish to destroy a single creature who wronged them, or fight against a corrupt organization that abuses the innocent, they dedicate their life to the destruction of their sworn foes.

#### oath of vengeance tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of Vengeance uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `destroy evil.` Combat your sworn foes at every opportunity. Fight the greater evil.

$\quad$ `no mercy.` No mercy for your sworn foes. Defeat evil by any means necessary.

$\quad$ `restitution.` Make restitution for the evil of your sworn foes and other evildoers.

### sworn foe
`3rd-LEVEL oath of vengeance FEATURE`

You have taken a Sacred Oath to destroy your Sworn Foe by any means necessary. Choose one creature type, two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs), or one organization (like a thieves' guild or demonic cult) to be your Sworn Foe.

As an action on your turn, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse yourself with the power of your Sacred Oath. For 1 hour, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to all ability checks made to track or recall knowledge about Sworn Foes, and all your attack rolls against Sworn Foes.

If your Sworn Foe is completely eradicated, or when you gain a Paladin level, you can perform a 24-hour ritual where you swear your Oath anew and designate a new Sworn Foe.
### vow of enmity
`3rd-LEVEL oath of vengeance FEATURE`

You mark evildoers for judgment. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and proclaim a Vow of Enmity at one creature you can see within 10 feet. For 1 minute or until it is slain, you have advantage on all attack rolls against it.

If the creature is also a Sworn Foe, it has disadvantage on all attack rolls against creatures other than you for 1 minute. 

Only one creature can be under your Vow of Enmity at a time. Using this feature on another creature ends the effect for the previous creature.
### vengeful smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of vengeance FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with your wrath. After the damage of the attack, your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened of you and its speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. The effect ends early if the creature takes damage.

Sworn Foes and the creature marked by your Vow of Enmity have disadvantage on this saving throw.
### aura of vengeance
`7th-LEVEL oath of vengeance FEATURE`

Your hatred for your foes emanates as a shield for your allies. When a creature under your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] is forced to make an ability check or saving throw by your Sworn Foe or the creature marked by your Vow of Enmity, they gain a bonus to that ability check or saving throw equal to 1d6.
### relentless avenger
`15th-LEVEL oath of vengeance FEATURE`

Your supernatural hatred helps you menace your sworn enemies. When your Sworn Foe or the creature marked by your Vow of Enmity attacks or forces a creature other than you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker and make a single melee attack against it.

If you are hit by an opportunity attack as part of this movement, your attack roll has advantage.
### avatar of vengeance
`20th-LEVEL oath of vengeance FEATURE`

As a bonus action on your turn, you can transform into an avatar of divine judgment. While you are transformed, you gain the following benefits for up to 1 minute:
- You cast [[misty step]] on each of your turns at will, without expending a spell slot. If you reappear within 5 feet of a creature, you can make a melee weapon attack against it.
- You have advantage on attack rolls against Sworn Foes.
- Once per turn, when you make a weapon attack roll with advantage, you can forgo advantage on your attack roll to make one additional weapon attack against that creature.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you become unconscious. Once you transform, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
