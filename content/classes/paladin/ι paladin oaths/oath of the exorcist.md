> Since the dawn of time, the world has been plagued by the scourge that is undeath. As ancient as the threat itself exists a brotherhood of paladins, known as Exorcists, whose divine purpose is to protect the living from the dead. These warriors taint their souls with the foul magic of undeath, giving up any chance of a normal life, to better defend the living world.

#### oath of the exorcist tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an oath of the exorcist uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `defend.` Life is a precious gift. All life, especially the innocent, must be protected at all costs.

$\quad$ `destroy.` Undead are a cruel mockery of life and must be hunted down and destroyed.

$\quad$ `focus.` Bear no titles or honors, inherit no lands, and have no family or children.

### sinister insights
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the exorcist FEATURE`

As an action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and grasp your holy symbol to enhance your knowledge of undead. For 1 hour, you have advantage on all ability checks related to undead or necromancy magic.
### exorcising smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the exorcist FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to try and sunder the target's soul. After the damage of the attack, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn, and can only take an action or a bonus action on their turn, not both.
### warrior of the dawn
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the exorcist FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and grasp your holy symbol, choosing one creature within 30 feet. For 1 minute, each time you deal damage to the target, you deal a bonus 1d4 radiant damage.
### spectral form
`7th-LEVEL oath of the exorcist FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can take on a Spectral Form that lasts until the end of your turn and grants you the benefits below:
- You are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical or non-silvered attacks.
- You can move through solid objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain.
- If you end your movement in an object or creature, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you traveled.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses of this feature remaining, you can expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to use Spectral Form again.

At 18th level, you can use this feature as a bonus action on each of your turns without expending a resource.
### sundering strike
`15th-LEVEL oath of the exorcist FEATURE`

Your holy light scours the souls of your foes. Whenever you deal radiant damage to a creature, it cannot regain hit points or become incorporeal until the beginning of your next turn.
### avatar of sacrifice
`20th-LEVEL oath of the exorcist FEATURE`

You grow so committed to your purpose, that you epitomize the concept of the Exorcist. You can sacrifice your vitality to resist the grasp of death. When you fall to 0 hit points but are not killed outright, you can spend one of your Hit Dice to drop to 1 hit point instead. If you have no Hit Dice remaining, you can expend 3 Divine Fervor to use this feature again.
