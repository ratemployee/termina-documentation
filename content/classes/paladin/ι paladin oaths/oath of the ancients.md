#### oath of the ancients tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Ancients uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `beauty.` Protect natural beauty and innocent life from any who threaten it.

$\quad$ `hope.` Kindle the light of hope with your actions and never give in to despair.

$\quad$ `light.` Delight in song, dance, and laughter. Spread joy through your actions.

### elder guardian
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the ancients FEATURE`

You have been marked as a friend and defender of the ancient and wild places. You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. If you speak in Sylvan you can communicate with beasts as if you were under the effects of a [[speak with animals]] spell.

You can also infuse others with the primal resilience of your Oath. As an action, you can touch one creature and expend 1 Divine Fervor to grant it temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### verdant smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the ancients FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse that strike with verdant power. After the damage of the attack, your target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by mystical vines for 1 minute.

A restrained creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the mystical vines are destroyed and the creature is no longer restrained.
### primal shield
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the ancients FEATURE`

When you or another creature within 10 feet takes cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can use a reaction to expend 1 Divine Fervor and reduce that damage by your Paladin level + your Charisma modifier.
### aura of warding
`7th-LEVEL oath of the ancients FEATURE`

The elder power of your Oath wards you and your allies from hostile magic. Creatures under your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] gain resistance to damage from spells while within your Aura.

In addition, you can now use Primal Shield to defend any creature that is within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]].
### undying sentinel
`15th-LEVEL oath of the ancients FEATURE`

Your body only ages 1 year for every 10 years that pass, and you cannot be aged by spells or magical effects. Also, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
### avatar of the ancients
`20th-LEVEL oath of the ancients FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can transform into an avatar of primal power, gaining the benefits listed below:
- You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turns.
- Primal Shield no longer costs Divine Fervor to use.
- The area within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] becomes difficult terrain for creatures of your choice.
- Creatures within 30 feet have disadvantage on saving throws to resist Paladin spells and Verdant Smite.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are unconscious. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. You can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
