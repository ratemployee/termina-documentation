> The Oath of Liberty calls paladins to use their power to stand with the oppressed against tyranny. It is not enough to enact justice but to see that justice is fairly applied to all. Paladins of Liberty are often despised by those who have seized power through nefarious means. Seen as threats to the established order, paladins who swear this Oath are often persecuted.

#### oath of liberty tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of Liberty uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `equality.` Birth, wealth, and status do not matter. Treat everyone you meet equally.

$\quad$ `equity.` All people should have access to basic needs, regardless of birth, status, or wealth.

$\quad$ `freedom.` Bring freedom to the oppressed and justice to the oppressor.

### admonish the tyrannical
`3rd-LEVEL oath of liberty FEATURE`

When a creature you can see within 30 feet deals damage to another creature, you can use your reaction and expend 2 Divine Fervor to rebuke it. For 1 minute, or until you lose concentration, that creature has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.
### shackling smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of liberty FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with the boundaries that you work to break free of. After the damage of the attack, your target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it is tethered to you for 1 minute and cannot move more than 60 feet away from you. The effect ends early if you attack another creature or end it as a bonus action on your turn.
### shield the meek
`3rd-LEVEL oath of liberty FEATURE`

When a creature that can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and expend 1 Divine Fervor to grasp your holy symbol and add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to its Armor Class against the attack, possibly turning a hit into a miss.
### aura of solidarity
`7th-LEVEL oath of liberty FEATURE`

The strength of your convictions protects those who stand alongside you. Whenever an allied creature within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] takes damage, it can reduce the damage by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### liberator
`15th-LEVEL oath of liberty FEATURE`

Your presence is a guiding light for those you defend. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can allow one creature in your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] to repeat a saving throw to end one hostile effect currently affecting it.
### avatar of freedom
`20th-LEVEL oath of liberty FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can transform into an avatar of divine freedom. While you are transformed, you gain the following benefits for up to 1 minute:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature, you can choose one creature (other than yourself) within your Aura of Protection to regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you just dealt.
- You can use your [[#shield the meek]] feature as a reaction on each of your turns, without expending Divine Fervor.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute. Once you transform, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
