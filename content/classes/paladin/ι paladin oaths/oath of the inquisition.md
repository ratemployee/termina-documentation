> Truth. All dedicated paladins who become Inquisitors have the same goal: reveal what is hidden, and purge the planes of those who obscure the truth. Above all, they despise creatures who hide their true form. Fiend, celestial, or fey; it matters not to the Inquisitor. Any creature, no matter its goals, that uses its power to deceive mortals, has forfeited its life.

#### oath of the inquisition spells

#### oath of the inquisition tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Inquisition uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `truth.` Do whatever it takes to bring the truth to light. Those who obscure the truth deserve harsh punishment.

$\quad$ `immutability.` All creatures have a natural form. Any who seek to physically alter or obscure their true form cannot be trusted.

$\quad$ `retribution.` Enforce punishments that fit the crime. A thief may lose their hand, but an Oathbreaker may forfeit their life.

### divine interrogation
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the inquisition FEATURE`

As an action, you grasp your holy symbol, expend 2 Divine Fervor, and recite a prayer of truth. One creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 10 feet must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or you learn its true name, and it has disadvantage on the first Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw you force it to make within the next minute.
### demanding smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the inquisition FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with divining magic. The damage of your Divine Smite becomes psychic, and you learn whether the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to one of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels, if any
### surprise inquisition
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the inquisition FEATURE`

When you roll initiative, so long as you are not surprised or incapacitated, you can use a reaction to hold aloft your holy symbol, expend 1 Divine Fervor, and force a number of creatures who can see or hear you within 30 feet (up to your Charisma modifier) to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are surprised.
### aura of truth
`7th-LEVEL oath of the inquisition FEATURE`

Your mere presence unravels lies and deception. Creatures of your choice within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] have advantage on saving throws to resist enchantment and illusion spells.
### iron will
`15th-LEVEL oath of the inquisition FEATURE`

You have honed your mind to resist any effects that would restrict your agency or obscure the truth for you. You are immune to both the charmed and frightened conditions.
### aura of inquisition
`20th-LEVEL oath of the inquisition FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can transform into an Avatar of divine truth and law, gaining the benefits below for the next minute:
- You gain truesight in a 120-foot radius.
- You instantly know if a creature is lying to you.
- Any shapechanger hit by one of your attacks reverts to its original form and takes an additional 2d8 radiant damage.

Once you transform, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
