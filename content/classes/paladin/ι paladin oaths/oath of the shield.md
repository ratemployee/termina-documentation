> While most paladins are known for the wrath they pour out upon their foes, those who swear the Oath of the Shield use their power to defend. Known as Divine Shields, these noble warriors stand as protectors of the innocent and defenseless. Bravely placing themselves between their allies and danger, a Divine Shield is an invaluable ally to have on the battlefield.

#### oath of the shield tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Shield uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `defend.` You are a shield for the defenseless. Your power must defend those who come to you for help, no matter the cost.

$\quad$ `immovable.` When you make a choice, stand by it. When you vow to defend another, defend them no matter the danger.

$\quad$ `resilient.` Remain unflinching in the face of foes. Do not back down from a challenge if there are innocent lives on the line.

### divine aegis
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the shield FEATURE`

As an action, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor and project a shimmering protective aura that extends outward from you in a 10-foot radius, which last until you move. Creatures of your choice within this radius gain the benefits of half cover.
### shielding smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the shield FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to disperse the vitality you rob your target of to your allies. You can give temporary hit points equal to half of the damage you deal to yourself or a creature of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you. These temporary hit points fade at the end of your next turn.
### holy abjuration
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the shield FEATURE`

As a reaction when you take damage from a spell or another magical effect, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor. The damage from the effect is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1) + your Paladin level. If this effect reduces the damage of the spell or effect to zero, the entire spell or effect is dispelled.
### aura of defense
`7th-LEVEL oath of the shield FEATURE`

When another creature within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to add your Charisma modifier to its Armor Class against the triggering attack.
### adamant stance
`15th-LEVEL oath of the shield FEATURE`

Once you take a stand there is nothing that can force you to move. Creatures that attempt to move you against your will must succeed on a Strength check with a DC equal to 10 + your Paladin level + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### divine bulwark
`20th-LEVEL oath of the shield FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can empower your Aura of Protection with the power of your Divine Aegis, granting creatures of your choice within it the benefits below for the next minute:
- At the start of your turn, you can distribute 20 temporary hit points among living creatures within your Aura.
- Creatures of your choice gain three-quarters cover.
- Whenever a creature within your Aura takes damage, you can choose to take the damage in place of that creature.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
