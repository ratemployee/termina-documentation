#### oath of the forge tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Forge uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `order.` Create order from disorder, whether by crafting raw material into works of artistry, or people into community.

$\quad$ `perfection.` Always strive for perfection in your chosen craft. The quest for perfection does not end while you draw breath.

$\quad$ `progress.` It is your duty to pass your knowledge on to the next generation, and ensure that they will surpass even you.

### molten weapon
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the forge FEATURE`

Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn and hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor to cause your weapon to pulse with fiery energy. As part of this same Attack action, you can make an additional weapon attack, and this additional attack deals fire damage in place of its normal damage types. 

You cannot [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]] with this additional attack.
### incendiary smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the forge FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can hold aloft one melee weapon and expend 1 Divine Fervor, imbuing it with the power of the Forge. For the next minute, the weapon deals fire damage in place of its normal damage type, and when you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]] with it, its damage becomes fire and you roll d10s in place of the d8s for Smite damage.
### ironworks
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the forge FEATURE`

As an action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and touch your holy symbol to a Medium or smaller nonmagical metal object and instantly transfigure it into a shape of your choosing. To use this feature to transfigure the metal into a work that would require skill or training, you must be proficient in the relevant set of artisan's tools.
### aura of iron
`7th-LEVEL oath of the forge FEATURE`

The power of your Oath imbues metal weapons and armor of your choice within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] with masterful quality. Armor grants its wearer a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and mundane weapons count as magical weapons.
### unyielding steel
`15th-LEVEL oath of the forge FEATURE`

Your armor is infused with the conviction of your Oath. Once per turn when you take damage, you can use your reaction to halve the amount of damage that you would take, so long as you are wearing heavy armor.

You can use this reaction once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses remaining, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor to use this feature again.
### avatar of the forge
`20th-LEVEL oath of the forge FEATURE`

As a bonus action on your turn, you can transform into an avatar of forge and fire. While transformed in this way, you gain the benefits listed below:
- Aura of Iron grants allied creatures resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- You can use your Unyielding Steel reaction on each of your turns without expending your use of it or any Divine Fervor.
- When you deal fire damage, you ignore resistance to fire damage and treat fire immunity as resistance.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute, but it ends if you are incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
