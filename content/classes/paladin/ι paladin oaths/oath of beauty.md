> Paladins who swear the Oath of Beauty hold themselves to a standard of excellence and strive to be gleaming beacons of beauty. Some use the power of their graceful visage to inspire the downtrodden. Others become obsessed with their elegant appearance and use the power of their Oath to manipulate, deceive, and intimidate those they see as beneath them.

#### oath of beauty tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of Beauty uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `grace.` Act with quiet dignity in combat, in your leisurely pursuits, and in public.

$\quad$ `perfection.` Always strive to improve yourself, both in combat skill and societal standing.

$\quad$ `reputation.` Hold yourself to the highest societal standard. Your reputation is everything.

### otherworldly elegance
`3rd-LEVEL oath of beauty FEATURE`

People of all walks of life are drawn to you, and inclined to hang on your every word. As an action, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor to enhance your appearance with divine glamour. For 1 hour, whenever you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.
### dazzling smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of beauty FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with your raw magnetism. After the damage of the attack, your target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is charmed by you for 1 minute and regards you as a friend. While charmed, the creature is agreeable to the courses of action you suggest, so long as they would not put the target in danger. The effect ends early if the creature takes damage.
### quell the defiler
`3rd-LEVEL oath of beauty FEATURE`

You can punish those that would dare to lash out against you. When a creature you can see within 30 feet attacks you, you can use a reaction to expend 1 Divine Fervor and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, its attack misses, and it is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, or until you attack the creature.
### aura of elegance
`7th-LEVEL oath of beauty FEATURE`

Your elegant visage bends others to your whims. Creatures of your choice within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] have disadvantage on saving throws against your illusion or enchantment spells.

You also have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) check you make against any creature within that same range, so long as you are not fighting it.
### beauty revealed
`15th-LEVEL oath of beauty FEATURE`

Your true beauty is terrible for your enemies to behold. When you are hit by an attack, you can use a reaction to reveal your true beauty, adding your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to your Armor Class against the triggering attack.

You can use this reaction once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses remaining, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to use this feature again.
### avatar of beauty
`20th-LEVEL oath of beauty FEATURE`

You can use a bonus action on your turn to reveal the fullness of the divine beauty that dwells within your mortal form. For the next minute, you gain the benefits listed below:
- You are immune to the charmed condition.
- When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
- You can cast [[charm person]] as a 1st-level spell as a bonus action on each turn, including the turn that you activate this transformation, without expending a spell slot.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
