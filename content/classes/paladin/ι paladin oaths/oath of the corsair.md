> Fearsome warriors of the high seas, Corsair paladins swear an Oath to themselves and their crew and will do whatever it takes to maintain their freedom. Chaotic by nature, these scallywags abhor any laws that aren't their own. While most paladins follow the law of the land or the tenets of a deity, Corsairs follow only laws they have personally agreed to. No matter their philosophy, Corsairs are all fiercely loyal.

You learn certain spells at Paladin levels as noted in the table below. They don't count against your total number of Spells Known and cannot be switched upon gaining a level.

#### oath of the corsair tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Corsair uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `bravery.` To be a coward is a fate worse than death. Live so others will sing of your deeds. Defend those who defend themselves.

$\quad$ `freedom.` Mortal creatures are meant to be free. No one should have to follow rules they did not agree to or have a voice in creating.

$\quad$ `loyalty.` Stay true to those who are loyal to you. Reward loyalty with glory and treasure. Traitors deserve ruthless judgment.

### all hands on deck
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the corsair FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor, hold aloft your holy symbol, and bellow an order to your allies. A number of creatures of your choice (up to your Charisma modifier) within 30 feet that can see or hear you can use their reaction to move up to their full speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
### watery smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the corsair FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with the power of a crashing wave. When you do so, all the damage dealt by your attack changes to cold damage, and you can treat a roll of 1 or 2 on any of the damage dice that you roll as part of that attack as a 3.
### ride the waves
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the corsair FEATURE`

Whether on sea or on land, you move with the agility necessary to maneuver the most precarious locales. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to take the Dash action.
### aura of gallantry
`7th-LEVEL oath of the corsair FEATURE`

Your presence inspires your allies to stand strong in the face of danger. You and creatures of your choice within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] have advantage on any saving throw or ability check they make to resist being grappled, knocked prone, or otherwise moved against their will.
### fury of the seas
`15th-LEVEL oath of the corsair FEATURE`

Those who dare strike you are punished for their mutinous actions. When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, it takes your choice of either cold, lighting, or thunder damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### avatar of the sea
`20th-LEVEL oath of the corsair FEATURE`

You are a living avatar of the high seas. As a bonus action on your turn, you can transform, becoming as terrible as a storm for 1 minute. While transformed you gain the benefits below:
- You are immune to cold, lightning, and thunder damage.
- You can cast [[command]] at 1st-level as a bonus action on each of your turns without expending a spell slot.
- Whenever you hit a Huge or smaller creature with a melee attack, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
