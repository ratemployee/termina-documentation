> Often working alongside druids, rangers, and paladins who have sworn an Oath of the Ancients, those who take the Oath of the Wilds swear to protect and embody the wild power of beasts. They are warriors of nature who stand in defense of a balanced relationship between civilization and the wilds.

#### oath of the wilds tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Wilds uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `balance.` Strive always to ensure that nature and civilization exist in a balance.

$\quad$ `freedom.` Like beasts of the wild, ensure that all living thing can choose its own path.

$\quad$ `natural law.` The natural law of the world is known to all creatures, and it is your task to uphold this order of all things.

### predator's mark
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the wilds FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and grasp your holy symbol to mark one creature you can see within 120 feet as your Prey. For 1 hour, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to any ability check that you make to track, tame, grapple, or subdue your Prey.
### primal smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the wilds FEATURE`

When you use [[paladin class overview#divine smite|divine smite]], you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with mind-altering magic that reduces the target to their base urges. After the damage of the attack, your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they must immediately use their reaction, if available, to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack against a target of your choosing. If no other targets other than you or your allies are available, you can force the target to attack themselves.
### soothe beast
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the wilds FEATURE`

As an action, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor and touch your holy symbol to a beast and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the beast is charmed by you for 1 hour, or until you or your allies do anything harmful to the creature.
### aura of savagery
`7th-LEVEL oath of the wilds FEATURE`

Your primal ferocity empowers you and your pack. Creatures of your choice within your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20 on melee weapon attack rolls.
### undying predator
`15th-LEVEL oath of the wilds FEATURE`

Not even death can keep you from defending the wilds. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.
### primal champion
`20th-LEVEL oath of the wilds FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can transform into a warrior of primal power. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:

- Creatures within your Aura of Protection score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 18-20 on the d20 for melee weapon attack rolls.
- You gain 10 temporary hit points at the start of each turn.
- You can use a bonus action on each turn to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the creature, you can make a melee weapon attack with advantage against it.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you are incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
