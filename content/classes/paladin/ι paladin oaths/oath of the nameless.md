> Paladins who swear the Nameless Oath enter into a secretive order of warriors who give up their personal identity to work toward the larger goals of their order. When they swear their Oath, these paladins don a mask or helm to forever obscure their features, swearing never to reveal their identity again.

#### oath of the nameless spells
You learn certain spells at Paladin levels as noted in the table below. They don't count against your total number of Spells Known and cannot be switched upon gaining a level.

| **Paladin Level** | **Spells**                                     |
| :---------------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
|        3rd        | [[disguise self]], [[longstrider]]             |
|        5th        | [[beast sense]], [[find steed]]                |
|        9th        | [[conjure volley]], [[crusader's mantle]]      |
|       13th        | [[freedom of movement]], [[guardian of faith]] |
|       17th        | [[circle of power]], [[swift quiver]]          |
#### oath of the nameless tenets
Though their specific Oath and cause may vary, all Paladins who swear a Nameless Oath uphold the Tenets below:

$\quad$ `brotherhood.` Always aid the members of the order, and they will always aid you in turn.

$\quad$ `greater good.` The needs and goals of the order come before anything else in life.

$\quad$ `honor.` Your mask is a symbol of your honor. Never reveal your identity to another.

### faceless wanderer
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the nameless FEATURE`

Your order taught you to survive on the road, specializing in traveling and combat on trained mounts. You gain proficiency in either Animal Handling or Survival, and when you make a check with either skill, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to your roll.

You also gain the Mounted Warrior [[paladin class overview#fighting style|fighting style]] if you do not already know it. If you have already adopted that Fighting Style, you gain another Fighting Style of your choice.

Finally, when you make a ranged weapon attack while you are riding a trained mount, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to your roll.
### nameless visage
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the nameless FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor to infuse your mask with mystical power. For 10 minutes, your visage causes creatures to trust in you, and whenever you make a Charisma check, you treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8.
### sacred smite
`3rd-LEVEL oath of the nameless FEATURE`

When you use Divine Smite, you can expend 2 Divine Fervor to infuse your strike with your honor. After the damage of the attack, your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, its face is bound in a mystical mask resembling your own. For 1 minute, it cannot see, hear, or perceive anything more than 10 feet away from it, even by magical means.

The creature can repeat this Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
### aura of the order
`7th-LEVEL oath of the nameless FEATURE`

The power of your Oath flows through your Aura. Creatures under your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]] manifest a shimmering mask and have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.
### beacon of honor
`15th-LEVEL oath of the nameless FEATURE`

You are a powerful beacon of the honor your mask stands for. When a creature under your [[paladin class overview#aura of protection|aura of protection]], including a trained mount, takes damage, you can use a reaction to take the damage in that creature's place.
### nameless avatar
`20th-LEVEL oath of the nameless FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can transform into an Avatar of every member of your order that has gone before you. Your mask expands to cover your whole body in gleaming armor which reflects it, and while transformed you gain these benefits:
- You instantly cast [[find steed]] at 4th-level, without having to expend a spell slot. However, this mount only remains for the duration of your Nameless Avatar transformation.
- You add your Charisma modifier to any weapon attack roll you make while you are riding this trained mount.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you are incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to transform again.
