### divine sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [[hallow]] spell.

You can use your Divine Sense once, and must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Once you swear your Sacred Oath, if you have no uses remaining, you can expend 1 Divine Fervor to use this feature again.
### lay on hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
### spellcasting
At 2nd level, you learn to draw upon the power of your faith to cast divine spells. You gain the following benefits:
#### spell slots
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast a Paladin spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells from the [[paladin spell list]]. The Spells Known column of the Paladin table shows when you learn more Paladin spells of your choice. Each spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

When you gain a Paladin level, you can choose one Paladin spell you know to replace with another Paladin spell of your choice that is also of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### oath spells
Each Sacred Oath has a list of Oath Spells that you learn at the Paladin levels in your Sacred Oath's description. The Oath Spells count as Paladin spells for you, but they do not count against your total number of Spells Known and they cannot be replaced when you gain a level in this class.
#### spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells; your power is drawn from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a paladin spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
#### spellcasting focus
You use a holy symbol as the focus for Paladin spells. A holy symbol is a Tiny object or emblem that represents the Tenets of your Oath. If it is emblazoned on a shield, it can be used as a spellcasting focus for Paladin spells.
### fighting style
Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

$\quad$ `blind warrior` You have blindsight with a range in feet equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. In that range, you can see invisible targets and anything that isn't behind total cover or hidden from you.

$\quad$ `classical swordplay` While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls and a +1 to your Armor Class so long as you are not using heavy armor or a shield.

$\quad$ `defensive fighting` So long as you are either wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

$\quad$ `dueling` When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with it.

$\quad$ `GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING` Whenever you make an attack with a heavy melee weapon as part of your Attack action, you can treat a total roll of 5 or lower on the weapon's damage dice as a 6. You must be wielding the weapon with two hands.

$\quad$ `mounted warrior` While you are riding a controlled mount, both you and your mount gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class, and you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to command the mount to take one action from its stat block.

$\quad$ `protector` When a creature you can see hits you or a target within 5 feet, with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the target's Armor Class against that attack. You must be wielding a shield or a melee weapon.

$\quad$ `shield warrior` You gain proficiency with shields as a martial melee weapon, and on a hit, your shield deals 2d4 bludgeoning damage. If you are wielding a shield and nothing else, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with your shield and to your Armor Class.

$\quad$ `strongbow` You can use your Strength modifier, in place of Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with longbows and shortbows. When you do so, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with those weapons.

$\quad$ `versatile fighting` While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls with that weapon. While doing so, you can also use your bonus action to make a single grapple or shove attack, or to take the Use an Object action.
### divine smite
You can channel the power of your faith into your weapons. Also starting at 2nd level, when you hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal bonus damage. This bonus damage is 2d8 for 1st-level slot, plus 1d8 for each slot level higher than 1st. This damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

The damage of this feature depends on your alignment:

| **Alignment** | **Damage Type** |
| :-----------: | :-------------: |
|     Good      |     Radiant     |
|    Neutral    |     Thunder     |
|     Evil      |    Necrotic     |
### divine health
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

In addition, you become in touch with your body and the magic that flows through you. During a short rest, you can recover spell slots of a combined level equal to your Charisma modifier. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use this feature again.

At 9th level, you gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the Poisoned condition.
### sacred oath
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. You choose from the following oaths:

- [[oath of beauty]]
- [[oath of devotion]]
- [[oath of liberty]]
- [[oath of mysticism]]
- [[oath of vengeance]]
- [[oath of the ancients]]
- [[oath of the corsair]]
- [[oath of the exorcist]]
- [[oath of the forge]]
- [[oath of the inquisition]]
- [[oath of the nameless]]
- [[oath of the shield]]
- [[oath of the wilds]]
- [[oathless]]
- [[blackguard]]

Your choice of oath grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 7th, 15th, and 20th level in this class.
#### sacred tenets
Each Sacred Oath has a set of Sacred Tenets which paladins of the Oath swear to uphold. Should a paladin knowingly and willingly violate a Tenet of their Oath, they cannot use Sacred Oath or Paladin class features, except for their Fighting Style, until they spend 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, making reparations appropriate to their Oath.

If a paladin consistently violates the Tenets of their Oath, they risk breaking it completely. Those who do may become Oathless Paladins, evil Blackguards, or may be forced to switch classes entirely.
#### divine fervor
The righteous power of your Sacred Oath is represented by a pool of Divine Fervor used to fuel various Paladin and Oath features. You have an amount of Divine Fervor equal to your Paladin level + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 0). You regain expended Divine Fervor when you finish a long rest.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### extra attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You retain the benefits of this feature if you violate your Oath.
### aura of protection
Your unwavering belief in yourself bolsters those around you. Beginning at 6th level, you exude an invisible Aura outward in a 10-foot radius as long as you aren't incapacitated. Your Aura only benefits you and creatures of your choice within range.

Creatures under the effects of your Aura of Protection add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +0) to saving throws.

At certain levels, the radius of Aura of Protection increases, as shown in the Aura Radius column of the Paladin table.
### aura of courage
Your Aura infuses those under its effects with great bravery in the face of evil and danger. Beginning at 10th level, creatures under your Aura of Protection are immune to the frightened condition. If a frightened creature enters your Aura, the effect is suspended while it remains within your Aura.
### improved divine smite
Your supernatural conviction infuses your strikes. Starting at 11th level, you deal a bonus 1d8 damage whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack. This bonus damage is the same type dealt by your Divine Smite.
### cleansing touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your divine power to drive out hostile spells. As an action, you can instantly end a single spell affecting you, or one willing creature that you touch.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses left, you can expend 5 Divine Fervor to use this feature again.
### aura of conviction
Your legendary conviction for your Oath infuses your Aura of Protection with wondrous power. Starting at 18th level, when a creature other than yourself under your Aura of Protection fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to allow it to reroll its saving throw. However, it must use the new result.

Once you use this feature to turn a failed saving throw into a successful one, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this reaction again. When you have no uses left, you can expend 5 Divine Fervor to use this reaction again.
