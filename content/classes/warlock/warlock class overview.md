<hr>

### otherworldly patron
In your profane research you have rediscovered, contacted, or forged a bargain with an otherworldly entity. You choose an Otherworldly Patron from the list below that best represents the entity you entered a Pact with:

- [[the ancient wyrm]]
- [[the archfey]]
- [[the darklord]]
- [[the deep one]]
- [[the exalted]]
- [[the fiend]]
- [[the great old one]]
- [[the legendary hero]]
- [[the noble genie]]
- [[the undying]]

Your Otherworldly Patron grants you features at 1st level, and again when you reach 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
#### patron magic
Each Otherworldly Patron has a list of Patron Spells that you learn at the Warlock levels noted in your Otherworldly Patron description. These spells count as Warlock spells for you, but they do not count against your total number of Spells Known.
#### eldritch blast
You can unleash the power of your Eldritch Invocations and your Patron as beams of arcane energy. While holding a Trinket containing an Invocation, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 120 feet. On a hit, it takes force damage equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier.
### pact magic
Your research and the power bestowed on you by your Patron has given you the ability to cast spells:
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[warlock spell list]].

You learn another Warlock cantrip at 4th and 10th level, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
#### spellcasting ability
As your Pact Magic is an extension of the otherworldly and esoteric knowledge you have gathered, you use Intelligence  as the spellcasting ability for any of the Warlock spells you know. You use Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell or ability, and when making a spell attack roll.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
#### spell slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of 1st through 5th-level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast a Warlock spell of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, if you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [[witch bolt]], you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
#### invocation spells
Spells that you learn through Invocations count as Warlock spells for you, but do not count against your Spells Known.
#### spellcasting focus
You can use any Trinket bearing an Eldritch Invocation, or an arcane focus, as a spellcasting focus for your Warlock spells.
### eldritch invocations
By 2nd level, you have unearthed fragments of dark, forgotten, and arcane power known as [[eldritch invocations]], which you have bound to Trinkets so that you may draw on this power. A Trinket is a tiny object reminiscent of the Invocation bound within. If one of your Trinkets is lost or destroyed, it reforms on your person at the end of your next short or long rest.

You begin with two such Trinkets, and bound within each is one Eldritch Invocation of your choice. When you reach certain Warlock levels you learn additional Invocations, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. If an Invocation has prerequisites, like a certain Warlock level, you can learn it at the same time that you meet any prerequisites it has.

When you gain a Warlock level, you can replace an Eldritch Invocation you know with another Invocation of your choice.

If an Invocation requires an attack roll or a saving throw, it uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC.
### pact boon
Your connection to your Otherworldly Patron has grown, and you have learned to channel their eldritch power into a Pact Boon which resembles the true nature of your Patron. At 3rd level, you gain a Pact Boon of your choice from the list below:
#### eldritch blade
You focus your Patron's power into a weapon of eldritch might. As a bonus action, you can conjure your Eldritch Blade in an empty hand. Each time you conjure it, your Eldritch Blade takes one of three forms: lightweight, versatile, or heavy, as detailed below. Regardless of its form, your Blade has the benefits below:
- It can be used as a Trinket for one Eldritch Invocation.
- You can use your Intelligence modifier, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.
- You are proficient with this weapon, even if you wouldn't be otherwise.
- The weapon counts as magical for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks.
- If lightweight, the weapon deals 1d8 piercing damage, and is considered to have the finesse property.
- If versatile, the weapon deals 1d8 slashing damage, or 1d10 slashing damage if wielded with two hands, and it considered to have the versatile property.
- If heavy, the weapon deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and is considered to have the two-handed property.

The Eldritch Blade disappears if it is more than 5 feet from you for 1 minute, if you conjure another Eldritch Blade, if you dismiss your Eldritch Blade (no action required), or if you die.

You can bond a magic melee weapon as an Eldritch Blade by performing a 1-hour ritual. You can use a bonus action to shunt it to an extradimensional space, or conjure it. Bonding a second weapon ends the bond for any previous weapons.
#### eldritch familiar
You focus your Patron's power to bind an Eldritch Familiar to your will. You learn [[find familiar]] and can cast it as a ritual, but it doesn't count against your number of Spells Known.

When you cast [[find familiar]], you can choose to conjure an Eldritch Familiar from the options detailed below.

Your Eldritch Familiar is bound to obey your orders to the best of its abilities. In combat, it shares your initiative and it acts on your turn. However, it will only take the Dodge action on its turn unless you use your bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block or another combat action.

Finally, whenever you cast a Warlock spell or use Eldritch Blast, you can choose for the spell, or any number of beams, to originate from your Familiar if you are within 60 feet.

Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes. Its equipment is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
#### eldritch tome
You focus your Patron's power into a dark grimoire known as an Eldritch Tome. It contains one copy of each Warlock spell you know, and this Tome grants you the following benefits:
- The Tome becomes the Trinket for an Eldritch Invocation of your choice that has no prerequisites. This Invocation does not count against your number of Invocations Known, and it cannot be replaced when you gain a Warlock level.
- At the end of a long rest, you can replace one Warlock spell you know with another Warlock spell of the same level.
- You can cast any Warlock spell contained within your Tome as a ritual if that Warlock spell has the ritual tag.

You can spend 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, to conjure an exact copy of your Tome, destroying any of the previous Tomes. If you die, your Tome turns to ash.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### empowered blast
You are able to draw out more power from your Invocations. Starting at 5th level, when you use Eldritch Blast, you create two beams. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones, but you make a separate attack roll for each.

At certain Warlock levels, the number of beams increases: at 11th level it creates three, and finally four at 17th level.
### elder arcanum
Leveraging the forbidden, occult, and sinister knowledge you have gathered, you gain insight into the secretive workings of the cosmos. This knowledge manifests as an Elder Arcanum. At 11th level, you learn one [[content/classes/warlock/elder arcanum|elder arcanum]] of your choice. You cannot learn an Arcanum more than once unless specific, and once chosen, it cannot be changed.

At certain Warlock levels, you unlock more of these esoteric secrets. You learn one additional Arcanum of your choice at 13th level, 15th level, and at 17th level.
### eldritch master
At 20th level, you can strain the eldritch power of your Pact in times of great need. Once per long rest, you can use an action to regain all of your expended Pact Magic spell slots.
