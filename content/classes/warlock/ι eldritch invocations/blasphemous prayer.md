`prerequisites: 5th-level warlock, eldritch tome`

A new page appears in your Eldritch Tome detailing a single Channel Divinity option of your choice from those available to any Cleric Divine Domain at 2nd level. You use your Warlock level and spell save DC for Cleric level or spell save DC.

You can invoke this Channel Divinity once, then you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke it again.
#### channel divinity: *arcane abjuration*
As an action, you can hold aloft your Eldritch Tome and attempt to turn one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned as if by the Cleric's Turn Undead feature. At higher levels, this Channel Divinity can destroy a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend if its CR is equal to or less than the CR of the Cleric's Destroy Undead feature.
#### channel divinity: *blood curse*
As an action, you can hold aloft your Eldritch Tome and force a creature within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw, so long as it has blood in its veins. On a failure, it is restrained for 1 minute as its blood congeals in its body.

A restrained creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
#### channel divinity: *death's spirit*
You can use a bonus action to strike your weapon against your Eldritch Tome and call upon the primordial spirit of Death itself. For 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated, die, or use a bonus action to end this effect, you are swathed in the spiritual shadow of a deathly being. Once per turn while swathed in this way, you can make an additional melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of you when you hit with a melee attack (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.
#### channel divinity: *strands of fate*
You can use a bonus action to enter a state that allows you to see and manipulate the strands of fate for 1 minute (or until you lose concentration, as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever another creature you can see makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can use a reaction to give the roll advantage or disadvantage (your choice).
#### channel divinity: *artisan's blessing*
You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.
#### channel divinity: *silent steps*
As an action on your turn, you can grasp your Eldritch Tome and cloak yourself in the mantle of your faith. For 1 minute, you become invisible and your movement does not produce any sound. This effect instantly ends early if you attack, cast a spell, or force a creature or object to make a saving throw.
#### channel divinity: *path to the grave*
As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.
#### channel divinity: *restful sojourn*
As an action on your turn, you can touch your Eldritch Tome to a willing creature, causing it to fall under the effects of the [[catnap]] spell. When you cast [[catnap]] in this way, the spell has its duration reduced to 1 minute.
#### channel divinity: *reveal truth*
As an action, you can present your holy symbol. Each creature or object in a 30-foot cone originating from your Eldritch Tome glows a color of your choice until the end of your next turn if any of the following applies to it:
- It is a shapechanger or is currently invisible.
- It is under the effects of illusion or transmutation magic.
- It has told a lie within the past minute.

A creature can attempt to resist this revelation by succeeding on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.
#### channel divinity: *preserve life*
As an action, you present your Eldritch Tome and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your warlock level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.
#### channel divinity: *radiance of the dawn*
As an action, you present your Eldritch Tome, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.
#### channel divinity: *enlightened spell*
When you cast one of your Patron Spells, you can expend your Channel Divinity to cast the spell so that it requires no verbal or somatic components, and no material components unless they are consumed by the spell.
#### channel divinity: *verdant cage*
As an action, you can present your Eldritch Tome and call upon nature. Magical vines, roots, branches, or other natural matter of your choice erupt from your body, forming an immobile 10-foot radius dome centered on you, which faces in a direction you choose when you create it. The dome persists for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). A creature that would be surrounded by the dome can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, it can move up to half its speed to escape the dome.

The sphere's AC is equal to your spell save DC, and its hit points are a number equal to 5 x your warlock level; it is immune to psychic damage and all conditions. The dome provides three-quarters cover from attacks and effects that pass through it. Additionally, creatures can't pass through the dome, and ability checks made to see anything past the dome are made with disadvantage.

While the dome has hit points, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and attacks against you can't benefit from advantage.
#### channel divinity: *order's demand*
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.
#### channel divinity: *balm of peace*
As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.
#### channel divinity: *destructive wrath*
When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.
#### channel divinity: *invoke duplicity*
As a bonus action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. While your duplicate remains, you can use a bonus action to move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. 
#### channel divinity: *twilight sanctuary*
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:
- You grant it temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + half of your warlock level (rounded down).
- You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.
#### channel divinity: *guided strike*
When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.
