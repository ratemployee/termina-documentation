`prerequisites: 5th-level warlock`

When you take damage, you can use your reaction to shield yourself in a crystal of ice, which has a number of hit points equal to ten times your Warlock level, and takes as much of the triggering damage as possible. While the ice's hit points remain, you are incapacitated and restrained within it, and you are immune to all damage. As an action, you can cause the remaining ice to instantly melt, destroying it.

Once you use this Invocation, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses of this Invocation remaining, you can expend one of your Pact Magic spell slots to use this Invocation again.
