As an action, you can awaken your senses to see the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. For 10 minutes, you can see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in that radius that bears magic, instantly learning its school of magic, if any. This sight is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. You must concentrate on this sense as if you were concentrating on a spell.
