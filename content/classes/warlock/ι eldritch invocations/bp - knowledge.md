### description
```
As an action, you can present your holy symbol. Each creature or object in a 30-foot cone originating from your Eldritch Tome glows a color of your choice until the end of your next turn if any of the following applies to it:
<ul><li> It is a shapechanger or is currently invisible.</li>
<li> It is under the effects of illusion or transmutation magic.</li>
<li> It has told a lie within the past minute.</li></ul>

A creature can attempt to resist this revelation by succeeding on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.
