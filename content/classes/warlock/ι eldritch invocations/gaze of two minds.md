As an action, you can touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. During this time, you benefit from all special senses the target possesses but you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

While you are both on the same plane of existence, you can use your action to extend this connection for one more turn.
