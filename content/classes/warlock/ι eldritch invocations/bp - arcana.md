### description
```
As an action, you can hold aloft your Eldritch Tome and attempt to turn one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned as if by the Cleric's Turn Undead feature. At higher levels, this Channel Divinity can destroy a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend if its CR is equal to or less than the CR of the Cleric's Destroy Undead feature.
