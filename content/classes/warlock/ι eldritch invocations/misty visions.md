As an action, you can conjure an illusory image of an object, creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube in a spot within 60 feet. This image must be purely visual; it cannot be accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. The image lasts for up to 10 minutes.

As an action, you can cause this illusory image to move to another spot within 60 feet. When you do so, you can choose for it to move in a way that appears natural for the image.

A creature that succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC sees through the illusion.

Conjuring a second illusion dispels any previous illusions.
