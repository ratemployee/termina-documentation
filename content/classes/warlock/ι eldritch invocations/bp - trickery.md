### description
```
As a bonus action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. While your duplicate remains, you can use a bonus action to move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
<p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses.
