### description
```
You can use a bonus action to enter a state that allows you to see and manipulate the strands of fate for 1 minute (or until you lose concentration, as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever another creature you can see makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can use a reaction to give the roll advantage or disadvantage (your choice).
