### description
```
As an action, you can force one creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it must subtract 1d4 from any d20 roll it makes for 1 minute.
<p>
It can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Creatures that succeed on this saving throw are immune to this effect until the next dawn.
