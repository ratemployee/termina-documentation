### description
```
As an action, you present your Eldritch Tome, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.
