### description
```
You can use a bonus action to strike your weapon against your Eldritch Tome and call upon the primordial spirit of Death itself. For 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated, die, or use a bonus action to end this effect, you are swathed in the spiritual shadow of a deathly being. Once per turn while swathed in this way, you can make an additional melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of you when you hit with a melee attack (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.
