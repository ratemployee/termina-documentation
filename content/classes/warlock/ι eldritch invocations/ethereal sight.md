`prerequisites: 7th-level warlock`

As an action, you can enhance your vision with the ethereal energy of undeath, allowing you to see through solid objects within 30 feet. For 1 minute, you have darkvision if you did not already, and you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent shadows of themselves. You must concentrate on this sense as if you were concentrating on a spell.
