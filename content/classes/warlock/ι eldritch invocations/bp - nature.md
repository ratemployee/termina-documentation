### description
```
As an action, you can present your Eldritch Tome and call upon nature. Magical vines, roots, branches, or other natural matter of your choice erupt from your body, forming an immobile 10-foot radius dome centered on you, which faces in a direction you choose when you create it. The dome persists for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). A creature that would be surrounded by the dome can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, it can move up to half its speed to escape the dome.
<p>The sphere's AC is equal to your spell save DC, and its hit points are a number equal to 5 x your warlock level; it is immune to psychic damage and all conditions. The dome provides three-quarters cover from attacks and effects that pass through it. Additionally, creatures can't pass through the dome, and ability checks made to see anything past the dome are made with disadvantage.
<p>While the dome has hit points, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and attacks against you can't benefit from advantage.
