### description
```
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:
<ul><li> You grant it temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + half of your warlock level (rounded down).</li>
<li> You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.</li></ul>
```
