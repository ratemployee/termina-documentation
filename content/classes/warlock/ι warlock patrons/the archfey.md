> You have entered a Pact with a powerful entity of the faerie. Whether you were gifted this Pact, or you tricked your Patron into granting you a measure of power, you can draw upon the whimsical and terrifying power of the Fey. Only the eldest of the faerie can form such Pacts; the Archfey of the Fey courts, ancient sylvan spirits, and the most powerful covens of hags.

#### fey magic
Your Patron infuses your magic with the mind-bending power of the Feywild. You can choose for your Eldritch Blast to deal psychic damage equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier.

You also learn the following Patron Spells at the Warlock levels below. When you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your Patron Spells with an enchantment or an illusion spell of the same level from the Bard or Druid spell list.

### fey presence
`1st-LEVEL the archfey FEATURE`

You can channel the magic of the faerie to beguile foes. As an action, you can force one creature within 10 feet that can see or hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it is either charmed by, or frightened of you for up to 10 minutes. This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage, or if you or your allies attack the creature or force it to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses left, you can expend one Pact Magic spell slot to use it again.
### beguiling blast
`6th-LEVEL the archfey FEATURE`

Your magic clouds the judgment of your foes. Whenever you deal psychic damage to a creature with your Eldritch Blast, it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. This feature has no effect on creatures that are immune to the charmed condition.
### misty escape
`6th-LEVEL the archfey FEATURE`

You can draw on the magic of the Fey to elude danger. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, cast a spell, or force a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses left, you can expend one Pact Magic spell slot to use it again.
### whimsical defense
`10th-LEVEL the archfey FEATURE`

The Fey power that infuses your magic grants you an affinity for enchantments. You are immune to the charmed condition.

Moreover, whenever a creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to turn the charm back on it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it is charmed by you as if by Fey Presence. If the creature is immune to the charmed condition, it instead takes psychic damage equal to your Warlock level on a failed save.
### terrible delights
`14th-LEVEL the archfey FEATURE`

The sickly sweet magic of your fey Patron overwhelms even the most stalwart minds. Your Warlock spells and features that impose the charmed condition ignore immunity to the charmed condition, but those creatures still have advantage on their saving throws to resist being charmed.

In addition, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Fey Presence feature, you can choose to plunge its mind into a realm of unfettered emotions. However, you must now concentrate on this effect as if you were concentrating on a spell.

For the next 10 minutes, the creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusory reality. The creature can repeat its Wisdom saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending this effect on a success. If a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
