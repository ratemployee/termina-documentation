> Each age has its heroes that stave off the darkness, and after their time has come, these heroes fade into legend and myth. Some especially powerfully heroes are able to avoid the grasp of death, and continue to protect the world, choosing suitably heroic mortals to serve as vessels of their legendary power.

#### legendary magic
Your Patron infuses your magic with its own mythic power. Whenever you fire a beam of your Eldritch Blast, you can choose for it to take the shape of a flying weapon, and on a hit it deals magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier.

You learn the following Patron Spells at the Warlock levels listed below. When you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your Patron Spells with an abjuration or an evocation spell of the same level from the Paladin or Ranger spell list.

### heroic armory
`1st-LEVEL the legendary hero FEATURE`

Your Patron infuses you with an innate knowledge of their skills with the armaments of war. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and all martial weapons.
### heroic resilience
`1st-LEVEL the legendary hero FEATURE`

You can call on your Patron to empower your body with their legendary determination. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one Pact Magic spell slot to gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1) + 1d8 per level of the spell slot you expended. While you have these temporary hit points, you cannot be frightened.

Unlike normal temporary hit points, these temporary hit points fade when you finish your next short or long rest.
### wondrous step
`6th-LEVEL the legendary hero FEATURE`

You can follow your strikes with heroic force. Once per turn, when you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to a creature with Eldritch Blast, you can instantly teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature.

Also, having a hostile creature within 5 feet of you does not impose disadvantage on your Eldritch Blast spell attack rolls.
### goading blast
`6th-LEVEL the legendary hero FEATURE`

Your Patron's heroic magic compels your foes to stand and face you. When you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to a creature with Eldritch Blast it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn, unless that attack targets you. This feature has no effect on creatures that are immune to the charmed condition.
### mythic determination
`10th-LEVEL the legendary hero FEATURE`

The spirit of your mythical Patron inspires you to press on where others fail. When you fail a saving throw, you can use a reaction to expend a Pact Magic spell slot to succeed instead.
### otherworldly champion
`14th-LEVEL the legendary hero FEATURE`

You directly channel your Patron, allowing them to walk in the world once more. You can use an action to transform into a heroic shade of your Patron, gaining the following benefits:
- You gain temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level.
- You have advantage on any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability checks and saving throws you make.
- Wondrous Step is no longer limited to once per turn.
- When you use Eldritch Blast, you can replace any of the beams you would fire with a melee weapon attack.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if you are incapacitated or choose to end it as a bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses remaining, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to transform again.
