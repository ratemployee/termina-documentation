#### undying magic
Your Patron infuses your magic with the unnatural power of undeath. Whenever you would fire a beam of Eldritch Blast, you can instead force a creature within that range to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier.

You also learn the following Patron Spells at the Warlock levels below. When you gain a Warlock level, you can replace a Patron Spell with a necromancy or transmutation spell of the same level from the Sorcerer or Warlock spell list.

### necrotic husk
`1st-LEVEL the undying FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can infuse your flesh with the power of undeath, decaying into the Necrotic Husk of your living body. While you are transformed, you gain the benefits below:
- When you transform, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level + your Intelligence modifier.
- Your physical appearance becomes terrifying to look upon.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.
- You are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. Once you transform in this way, you must finish a short or long rest before you can transform again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to transform again.
### touch of the grave
`1st-LEVEL the undying FEATURE`

The magic infused in you by your Pact makes you appear to other undead as one of their own. Undead of a CR equal to your Warlock level or lower are not hostile toward you until you say or do something hostile to them, such as attacking them, forcing a saving throw, or threatening them.

For example, you could walk among a group of zombies and they would not attack you unless you attacked them first.
### lifedrinker
`6th-LEVEL the undying FEATURE`

The unnatural power your wield allows you to feed on the life of others. Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage with your Eldritch Blast to a creature that is not undead, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

If you are in your Necrotic Husk form, you can add these temporary hit points to any temporary hit points you have.
### unsettling visage
`6th-LEVEL the undying FEATURE`

When you force a creature within 30 feet that can see you to make a saving throw to resist being frightened while you are in your Necrotic Husk form, it has disadvantage on its roll.
### unnatural resilience
`10th-LEVEL the undying FEATURE`

Your mortal life has been fortified by unnatural magic. You are resistant to necrotic damage, and when you are in your Necrotic Husk form, you are immune to necrotic damage.

Also, when you have temporary hit points, you are resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
### unending life
`14th-LEVEL the undying FEATURE`

The power you wield makes you nearly impossible to kill. You can cast the [[death ward]] spell, targeting only yourself, without expending a Pact Magic spell slot. Once you cast [[death ward]] in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

Moreover, if you begin your turn with less than half of your hit points remaining, but at least 1 hit point, you regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1).
