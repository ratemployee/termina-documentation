> You have bonded yourself to a primordial force of the ancient waters, known as a Deep One. These Thalassic entities often enter into Pacts with desperate sailors, expert navigators, or scholars of the oceans. Any aquatic being of sufficient power can form such a Pact, but ancient krakens, primordial water elementals, and demigods of the ocean are most common.

#### deep magic
Your Patron has infused your magic with the ancient power of the depths. You can choose for your Eldritch Blast to deal cold damage equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier.

You also gain the following Patron Spells at the Warlock levels below. Whenever you gain a Warlock level you can replace a Patron Spell with an abjuration or transmutation spell of the same level from the Druid or Warlock spell list.

### grasp of the deep
`1st-LEVEL the deep one FEATURE`

You can call forth one of the many tendrils of your Patron. As a bonus action, you can conjure a spectral Tentacle in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet.

As a bonus action, including the bonus action used to conjure it, you can move this Tentacle up to 30 feet and use it to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 cold damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it is grappled by the Tentacle.

A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, escaping on a success.

This spectral Tentacle remains for up to 1 minute, but it disappears if you conjure another spectral Tentacle. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### scion of the deep
`1st-LEVEL the deep one FEATURE`

Your Pact has altered your physiology. You gain the [[gift of the deep ones]] Eldritch Invocation, and it does not count against your total number of Invocations Known. If you already know this Invocation, you learn another Invocation of your choice.

Regardless, you cannot replace [[gift of the deep ones]] with another Eldritch Invocation when you gain a Warlock level.
### oceanic grasp
`6th-LEVEL the deep one FEATURE`

Your oceanic magic freezes your foes. Whenever you deal cold damage to a creature with Eldritch Blast, a Tentacle attack, or a Warlock spell of 1st-level or higher, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the beginning of your next turn.
### thalassic speech
`6th-LEVEL the deep one FEATURE`

Your eldritch connection to the depths grants you mystical abilities. You gain resistance to cold damage, and while you are fully submerged in water, any other creature that is fully submerged in water can understand your speech, and you can understand its speech as if you share a language.
### greater tentacles
`10th-LEVEL the deep one FEATURE`

When you cast [[eldritch tentacles]], your concentration cannot be broken unless you end it, or you become unconscious.

Also, any Tentacles you conjure with your Grasp of the Deep feature gain the following benefits:
- They can grapple creatures that are Huge or smaller.
- They deal an additional 1d8 cold damage on a hit.
- Any creature grappled by a Tentacle has disadvantage on saving throws to resist your Warlock spells.
### unleash the depths
`14th-LEVEL the deep one FEATURE`

You can bring the full power of your Patron to the surface. As an action, you can use Grasp of the Deep to conjure five spectral Tentacles each in its own unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet.

As an action, including the action you used to conjure the Tentacles, you can make one melee spell attack with each of these Tentacles against a creature within 10 feet. If a target would be grappled by more than one Tentacle, it is restrained by the Tentacles. A restrained creature can escape from all Tentacles with one successful check.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses left, you can expend one of your Pact Magic spell slots to use it again.
