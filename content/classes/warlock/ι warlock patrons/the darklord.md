> You have entered into a Pact with one of the sinister rulers of the Shadowfell. Known as Darklords, these powerful beings are most often imprisoned within Domains of Dread, and are only able to affect the outside world through trusted servants. Imbued with a fraction of the Darklord's power, warlocks can wield the sinister power of shadows against their foes.

#### darklord magic
Your Patron infuses your magic with the dark powers of the Shadowfell. You can choose for your Eldritch Blast to deal necrotic damage equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier.

You also learn the following Patron Spells at the Warlock levels below. When you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your Patron Spells with a necromancy or illusion spell of the same level from the Sorcerer or Warlock spell list.

### fell curse
`1st-LEVEL the darklord FEATURE`

You can infuse your occult magic with the sinister powers of your Patron. You know the [[hex]] spell, and you cannot replace it with another spell when you gain a Warlock level. You gain the following additional benefits against creatures you [[hex]]:
- Your weapon and spell attack rolls against the creature score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
- If you kill it, you can end [[hex]] to gain temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level + your Intelligence modifier.

When you cast [[hex]], your concentration cannot be broken unless you willingly end it, or you become unconscious.

Finally, once between each long rest, you can cast the [[hex]] spell at 1st-level without expending a Pact Magic spell slot.
### shadow warrior
`1st-LEVEL the darklord FEATURE`

You wreath yourself in defensive shadow. You gain the [[armor of shadows]] Eldritch Invocation, but it does not count against your number of Invocations Known. If you already know this Invocation, you learn another Invocation of your choice.

Regardless, you cannot replace [[armor of shadows]] with another Eldritch Invocation when you gain a Warlock level.
### living shadow
`6th-LEVEL the darklord FEATURE`

You can animate your own shadow to vex your foes. As an action, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to animate your own shadow. Your shadow comes to life and uses the Shadow stat block with the changes below:
- Its maximum hit points increase by your Warlock level.
- It acts during your turn in combat, but it can only take the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to command it to use an action from its stat block, or another action.
- It uses your Warlock spell attack modifier for attack rolls.
- It can appear as your normal shadow while in your space.

Moreover, when your Living Shadow is within 30 feet, you can use your action to merge with it and gain temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level, destroying it. When your Shadow is destroyed, it returns to you as a normal shadow.
### dread mantle
`10th-LEVEL the darklord FEATURE`

Your mastery over the dark magic of the Shadowfell protects you from death and decay. You have advantage on your death saving throws, and you gain resistance to necrotic damage.
### right hand of dread
`14th-LEVEL the darklord FEATURE`

You channel the dark power of your Pact to its full potential. You gain the following benefits against creatures you [[hex]]:
- Whenever you take damage from it, you can reduce the damage by your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1).
- Whenever it forces you to make a saving throw, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the result of your roll.
- Your Shadow has advantage on attack rolls against it.

Finally, [[hex]] no longer requires your concentration, but you can only have one instance of the [[hex]] spell active at a time.
