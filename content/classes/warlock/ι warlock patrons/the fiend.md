> You have entered into a Pact with a powerful Fiend from the lowest planes of existence. Whether you struck a bargain, you were coerced, or you tricked your Patron, you are now linked to a being of absolute evil. Only the most powerful Fiends can serve as Patrons; Archdevils, Demon Lords, and particularly powerful servants of extraplanar evil are the most common.

### dark blessing
`1st-LEVEL the fiend FEATURE`

You can draw vitality from death. Whenever you kill a hostile creature, you can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level + your Intelligence modifier.
### accursed blast
`6th-LEVEL the fiend FEATURE`

Your magic scours the very soul of your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature with Eldritch Blast, it cannot regain hit points until the beginning of your next turn.
### dark bargain
`6th-LEVEL the fiend FEATURE`

You can sacrifice your vitality to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or saving throw, you can roll a d10, adding the result to your roll and reducing your hit points by the same amount. You must choose to use this feature before you roll the d20 for your ability check or saving throw.
### fiendish resilience
`10th-LEVEL the fiend FEATURE`

At the end of each short or long rest, you choose one type of damage. You gain resistance to that type of damage until the end of your next short or long rest. Damage you take from magical or silvered weapons ignores this resistance.
### hurl through hell
`14th-LEVEL the fiend FEATURE`

You can temporarily inflict the horrors of hell upon your foes. When you deal damage to a creature with Eldritch Blast you can teleport it to the infernal plane of your Patron, where it experiences the full horror of that plane. At the end of your next turn, it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. If the creature was not a fiend, it takes 6d10 psychic damage as it grapples with the horror.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
