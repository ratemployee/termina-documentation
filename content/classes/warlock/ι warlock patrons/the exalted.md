> You have entered into a Pact with a powerful Celestial native to the upper planes of existence. Whether your Patron sought you out as an ally or you proved yourself worthy, you are now bound to a being of absolute good. Only the most powerful of the heavenly hosts can serve as Patrons; Archangels, scions of gods, and powerful demigods of good are most common.

### celestial light
`1st-LEVEL the exalted FEATURE`

You can channel the divine power of your Pact to heal others. When you fire a beam of your Eldritch Blast, you can instead choose to channel a beam of healing light at one creature you can see within range, restoring 1d10 hit points to the target.

You can do so a number of times equal to 1 + your Warlock level, and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
### radiant conduit
`6th-LEVEL the exalted FEATURE`

Your mastery over your Pact allows you to better channel its divine power. Once per turn when you use Eldritch Blast to deal radiant damage or restore hit points with Celestial Light, you can expend multiple uses of Celestial Light (up to your Intelligence modifier) to increase the radiant damage or the hit points you restore by 1d10 per use expended.

Finally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to regain a number of uses of Celestial Light equal to the level of your Pact Magic spell slots.
### celestial fortitude
`10th-LEVEL the exalted FEATURE`

Your divine presence fortifies you and your allies. Each time you finish a short or long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level + your Intelligence modifier. You can also choose up to five creatures who completed the short or long rest with you to also gain temporary hit points equal to half your Warlock level + your Intelligence modifier.
### blinding defiance
`14th-LEVEL the exalted FEATURE`

The heavenly power infused into your Pact allows you to resist death. When you make a death saving throw, you can choose to instantly return to life with half your maximum hit points, stand up, and unleash a burst of radiant light.

When you do, creatures of your choice within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, creatures take 8d6 radiant damage and are blinded until the end of your current turn. On a success, they take half as much radiant damage and are not blinded.

Once you use this feature to return to life, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
