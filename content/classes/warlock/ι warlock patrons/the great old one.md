> You have made a Pact with an incomprehensible entity from beyond the reaches of your reality. Perhaps it is from the Far Realm or the void between the stars. The desires of the Great Old Ones are incomprehensible to mortals, and true knowledge of the vast alien intelligence of your Patron would shatter your mind and render you completely insane.

#### aberrant magic
Your Patron has tainted your magic with aberrant powers. Whenever you would fire a beam of Eldritch Blast, you can instead force a creature within range of your Eldritch Blast to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier.

You also learn the following Patron Spells at the Warlock levels listed below. When you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one Patron Spell with a divination or enchantment spell of the same level from the Bard or Wizard spell list.

### awakened mind
`1st-LEVEL the great old one FEATURE`

You can telepathically communicate with any creature you can see within 60 feet. You don't need to share a language, but the target must speak at least one language to respond. You can only communicate with one creature at a time.

You also gain resistance to psychic damage.
### mental lance
`6th-LEVEL the great old one FEATURE`

Your magic pierces the minds of your foes, sowing confusion and dulling their senses. Whenever you deal psychic damage to a creature with Eldritch Blast, it can't take reactions until the beginning of your next turn.
### psionic ward
`6th-LEVEL the great old one FEATURE`

You can repel attacks with your mental abilities. Whenever a creature you can see targets you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on its attack roll. If the triggering attack misses, you can target the attacker with one beam of your Eldritch Blast as part of the same reaction.
### thought shield
`10th-LEVEL the great old one FEATURE`

The power of your incomprehensible Patron has warped your mind. Your thoughts cannot be read by telepathy or any other magical or psionic means unless you allow them to be read.

Also, when you are forced to make a Wisdom saving throw, you can choose to make an Intelligence saving throw instead.
### create thrall
`14th-LEVEL the great old one FEATURE`

The incomprehensible power that has taken root within your mind allows you to dominate the weak. As an action, you can touch an incapacitated humanoid and turn them into a Thrall.

This Thrall is charmed by you, and you can telepathically issue it commands so long as you are both on the same plane of existence. It obeys your commands to the best of its ability, but will not follow commands that cause it immediate harm.

The creature remains your Thrall until it dies, it is targeted by [[remove curse]] or another abjuration spell of similar power, or if you use this feature to create another Thrall.
