### draconic spark
`1st-LEVEL the ancient wyrm FEATURE`

Your Patron has infused you with a Draconic Spark, a fraction of its power. Ancient dragons can impart any element, but they usually bestow the element that matches their breath weapon. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison as the damage type of your Draconic Spark. Once chosen, it cannot be changed and grants you the benefits below:
- You gain resistance to that type of damage.
- When you cast a Warlock spell or cantrip, you can choose for it to deal your Draconic Spark damage in place of its normal damage.
- You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic.
### elemental potency
`6th-LEVEL the ancient wyrm FEATURE`

Your affinity with your Draconic Spark has grown. When you deal Draconic Spark damage with a Warlock spell or Eldritch Blast, you can treat a roll of 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3.
### regal presence
`10th-LEVEL the ancient wyrm FEATURE`

You have developed willpower to rival your ancient Patron. You are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.

You also add your Intelligence modifier (minimum: +1) to any Charisma checks you make.
### draconic wings
`14th-LEVEL the ancient wyrm FEATURE`

As a bonus action on your turn, you can manifest (or retract) a pair of leathery Draconic Wings that sprout from your back. These wings grant you a flying speed of 60 feet and destroy any clothing or armor not designed to accommodate them.
