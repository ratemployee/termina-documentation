`prerequisites: 13th-level warlock, eldritch familiar`

While you and your Eldritch Familiar are within 30 feet of each other, you both have advantage on any saving throws you make against spells or other magical effects.

Also, when you cast a Warlock spell that targets yourself, you can choose for your Eldritch Familiar to also gain the benefits of the spell so long as it is within 30 feet of you.

You and your Eldritch Familiar have advantage on all saving throws you make against spells or other magical effects if you are within 30 ft. of each other. If you cast a Warlock spell that targets only you, you can choose for your Eldritch Familiar to also gain the benefits if it is within 30 ft. of you.
