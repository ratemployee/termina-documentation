`prerequisites: 11th-level warlock, eldritch tome`

The occult power of your Tome allows you to prepare spells and eldritch powers. During each long rest, you can perform an occult 1-hour ritual with your Tome to replace any number of your Warlock Spells Known with another Warlock spell of your choice of 1st-level or higher.

Moreover, as part of this ritual, you can replace one Eldritch Invocation you know with another Eldritch Invocation of your choice. However, this new Eldritch Invocation must be of the same prerequisite level as the Eldritch Invocation it replaces.
