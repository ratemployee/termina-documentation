`prerequisites: 11th-level warlock, eldritch blade`

You can weave occult spells between your attacks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast one Warlock spell of 1st-level or higher in place of one of your attacks.

If this spell forces a target to make a saving throw, it makes its saving throw with disadvantage if you hit that target with an Eldritch Blade attack as part of the same Attack action.
