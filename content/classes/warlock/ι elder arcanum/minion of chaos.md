`prerequisites: 11th-level warlock, eldritch familiar`

As an action, you can infuse your Eldritch Familiar with the full power of your Pact. It transforms, as if by the [[polymorph]] spell, but it must use the stat block from the corresponding spell on the table below as if the spell were cast at 6th-level:

| **Eldritch Familiar** | **Spell**                  |
| :-------------------: | :------------------------- |
|       Aberrant        | [[summon aberration]]      |
|       Draconic        | [[summon draconic spirit]] |
|        Faerie         | [[summon fey]]             |
|       Infernal        | [[summon fiend]]           |
