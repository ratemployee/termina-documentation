`prerequisites: 15th-level warlock, eldritch familiar`

You can dominate other creatures with the eldritch chains of your Pact. You learn the [[hold monster]] spell, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or the material components, so long as your target is a celestial, elemental, fey or fiend.

You can target an individual creature with [[hold monster]] in this way once per long rest, after which, you must expend a Pact Magic spell slot to target it with [[hold monster]] again.
