`prerequisites: 15th-level warlock, eldritch blade`

As an action, you can infuse your Eldritch Blade with the full power of your Pact and disappear. Choose up to five creatures you can see within 60 feet and make a single Eldritch Blade attack against each one. On a hit, they take 6d10 damage of the same type as your Eldritch Blast. Each attack also applies any additional effects of your Eldritch Blast. You then reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of one of your targets.

Once you use this Arcanum, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. However, if you have no uses left, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to use it again.
