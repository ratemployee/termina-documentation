`prerequisites: 17th-level warlock, eldritch blade`

Your Eldritch Blade has gained a level of sinister sentience. While you are holding your Eldritch Blade, you cannot have disadvantage on attack rolls, and whenever you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you add your Intelligence modifier to your roll.

Finally, once per turn when you make an attack roll with your Eldritch Blade, you can choose to use your Warlock level in place of rolling the d20 for that attack.
