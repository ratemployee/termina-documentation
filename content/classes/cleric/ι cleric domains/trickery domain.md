> [!quote|badge] 
> Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.

### blessing of the trickster
`1st-LEVEL trickery domain FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with your choice of Deception, Stealth, or Sleight of Hand.
### establish alibi
`1st-LEVEL trickery domain FEATURE`

You gain the ability to alter how you appear to others. As an action, choose an activity you're capable of performing without casting a spell. You create an illusion in the space you occupy, which can make sounds but can't move beyond a 5-foot cube centered on you; it stays in your space and plays out the course of action you described to the best of its ability. Any actions you perform in its space are disguised, though a creature can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC; on a success, the illusion becomes faint, transparent, and clearly false to it, but remains.

The illusion persists until you die or you move from the space where you created it.

At 6th level, the illusion can also produce other sensory effects such as body heat or odors.
### channel divinity: *invoke duplicity*
`2nd-LEVEL trickery domain FEATURE`

You can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself. As a bonus action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. While your duplicate remains, you can use a bonus action to move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when you use your Establish Alibi, you can choose for the illusion to apply to the duplicate instead of yourself, and when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
### mischievous malcontent
`6th-LEVEL trickery domain FEATURE`

Your mischievous nature disturbs and confuses your enemies. When a creature you can see deals damage to you with an attack or spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, a creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute.

While frightened in this way, the creature believes harming you or taking hostile actions toward you is exactly what you want it to do. It might believe it makes you stronger with every attack, you're actually invincible and just wasting its time, or that you've disguised its ally as yourself. Regardless of its belief, the frightened creature must use its bonus action to communicate its belief to any allies that can hear it. A frightened creature can make a saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.
### potent spellcasting
`8th-LEVEL trickery domain FEATURE`

When you deal damage with a cleric cantrip, you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the damage roll.

At 14th level, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher through your duplicate that deals damage, you can add your Wisdom modifier to one of the damage rolls.
### doubled duplicity
`17th-LEVEL trickery domain FEATURE`

You can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.
