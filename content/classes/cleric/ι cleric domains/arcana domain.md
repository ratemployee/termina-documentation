> Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

| **Cleric Level** | **Spells**                           |
| :--------------: | ------------------------------------ |
|       3rd        | [[magic missile]], [[shield]]        |

### arcane initiate
`1st-LEVEL arcana domain FEATURE`

You gain proficiency in Arcana, and you learn two cantrips from the [[wizard spell list]]. They count as cleric spells for you, but they don't count against your number of Cantrips Known.
### channel divinity: *arcane abjuration*
`2nd-LEVEL arcana domain FEATURE`

As an action, you can hold aloft your holy symbol and attempt to turn one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned as if by your [[cleric class overview#turn undead|turn undead]] feature.

As you gain levels in this class, this Channel Divinity can destroy a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend if its CR is equal to or less than the CR of your [[cleric class overview#Destroy Undead|Destroy Undead]] feature.
### spell breaker
`6th-LEVEL arcana domain FEATURE`

Your magic dispels all but the most potent curses and spells. When you restore hit points to a creature with a cleric spell, you can also end a spell of your choice affecting that creature of a level equal to the spell slot you expended or lower.
### potent spellcasting
`8th-LEVEL arcana domain FEATURE`

When you deal damage with a cleric cantrip, you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the damage roll.

At 14th level, your 1st-level Domain Spells can be cast as bonus actions, instead of an action.
### arcane mastery
`17th-LEVEL arcana domain FEATURE`

Your god grants you an understanding of arcane magic rivals that of the most powerful archmages. You add one spell of your choice of 6th-level, 7th-level, 8th-level, and 9th-level from the Wizard spell list to your list of Arcana Domain spells.

However, these spells must be chosen from the abjuration, divination, or transmutation schools of magic.

Like the rest of your Arcana Domain Spells, each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level from the [[wizard spell list]], from the spell schools above.
