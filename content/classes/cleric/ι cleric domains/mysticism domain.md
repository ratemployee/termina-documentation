> While almost all Clerics draw their power from worship of a specific god, there are some secretive sects of hermits that derive power from their belief in themselves. They spend their lives in quiet solitude, mastering their minds and striving for enlightenment. After years of training and meditation, these monastic masters are able to awaken the inner potential of their minds, and can use this power to produce divine magic.

You have awakened the wondrous true potential of your mind. Whenever you cast a cleric cantrip or cleric spell that deals radiant damage, it deals psychic damage instead.
### unarmored defense

You have gained minor precognitive abilities. So long as you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
### channel divinity: *enlightened spell*
`2nd-LEVEL mysticism domain FEATURE`

When you cast one of your Mysticism Domain Spells, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast the spell so that it requires no verbal or somatic components, and no material components unless they are consumed by the spell.
### aura of psionic defense
`6th-LEVEL mysticism domain FEATURE`

Your mind is a powerful defense for you and your allies. You gain resistance to psychic damage, and when you or a creature you can see within 15 feet makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can use a reaction to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1) to the roll.
### potent spellcasting
`8th-LEVEL mysticism domain FEATURE`

When you deal damage with a cleric cantrip, you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the damage roll.

At 14th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals psychic damage to a creature or restores hit points to one, you can choose one of the following effects:
- You know the creature's location so long as they remain within a number of miles equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1), for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1).
- You can communicate telepathically with the creature so long as they remain within a number of miles equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1), for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1). So long as they understand the language that you speak, they can respond to your communications.
### mystic enlightenment
`17th-LEVEL mysticism domain FEATURE`

Your mind and body have become saturated with psionic power. You are immune to psychic damage, and so long as you are not wearing armor, you are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
