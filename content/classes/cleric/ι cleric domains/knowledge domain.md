Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. Others promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the world, and learn all they can.

### blessings of knowledge
`1st-LEVEL knowledge domain FEATURE`

Your connection to your domain's wisdom enhances your knowledge. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

Additionally, when you would make an Intelligence ability check using a skill with which you're proficient, you can make a Wisdom check instead.
### minor secrets
`1st-LEVEL knowledge domain FEATURE`

You learn to coax the truth out of the world around you. Over a course of 10 minutes, which can be accomplished during a short or long rest, you can perform a ritual to learn the truths of an area that you can see. The area is a cube of a number of feet equal to 10 x your cleric level.

At the completion of the ritual, you learn any two of the following details about the area:
- If the area is currently under the effects of a curse of an illusion, such as a [[programmed illusion]] spell or the illusions present in an aboleth's lair.
- If a humanoid of your choice has spoken a lie within the area in the last hour—though you do not learn the lie.
- If any humanoids died within the area in the last 8 hours, and if so, how—though you do not learn who killed the humanoid if they were murdered.
- If there are any secret doors or traps within the area—though not the precise locations of them.
- If any magical objects spent more than 1 minute in the area during the last 24 hours.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
### channel divinity: *reveal truth*
`2nd-LEVEL knowledge domain FEATURE`

You can use your Channel Divinity to reveal disguises and illusions. As an action, you can present your holy symbol. Each creature or object in a 30-foot cone originating from your holy symbol glows a color of your choice until the end of your next turn if any of the following applies to it:
- It is a shapechanger or is currently invisible.
- It is under the effects of illusion or transmutation magic.
- It has told a lie within the past minute.

A creature can attempt to resist this revelation by succeeding on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.
### gifted
`6th-LEVEL knowledge domain FEATURE`

Your prowess for research and discovery has hardened your mind. You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against illusions.

Additionally, as an action, you can gaze over an object depicting writing, iconography, or imagery, such as a page from a book, a scroll, a wall decorated in hieroglyphics, or a tapestry. Until you use this feature again, you can accurately recall all details and information present on the object
### potent spellcasting
`8th-LEVEL knowledge domain FEATURE`

When you deal damage with a cleric cantrip, you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the damage roll.

At 14th level, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals psychic damage, you can add your Wisdom modifier to one of the damage rolls.
### major secrets
`17th-LEVEL knowledge domain FEATURE`

You learn to uncover the truths of the multiverse. You always have [[legend lore]] prepared, it doesn't count toward your total number of spells prepared, and you ignore the spell's material components.

Additionally, when you use your Minor Secrets feature, you can cast a divination spell of 5th-level or lower as a part of the ritual without expending a spell slot. If the spell would normally effect a range or area that is smaller than that of your Minor Secrets area, it instead effects the entire area.
