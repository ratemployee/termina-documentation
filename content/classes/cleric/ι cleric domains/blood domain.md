> Clerics that serve gods of this Domain draw upon the power of life-blood to perform great and terrible feats. When there are no creatures from which to draw blood, these clerics must sacrifice their own vitality to work their magic. Blood clerics often serve gods that revel in suffering, but some wield this ancient power to serve noble ends.

### bonus proficiencies
`1st-LEVEL blood domain FEATURE`

You become familiar with implements of all sorts that draw blood. You gain proficiency with all martial weapons that deal either slashing or piercing damage.
### bloodwell
`1st-LEVEL blood domain FEATURE`

When you draw blood, you can channel it into a sinister ward, known as a Bloodwell. Whenever you deal necrotic, piercing, or slashing damage to a creature with blood in its veins, your Bloodwell gains hit points equal to half the damage you dealt to the creature. Whenever you take damage, your Bloodwell takes the damage first, and if it is reduced to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

Your Bloodwell can have a maximum number of hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Cleric level.

You can sacrifice your own life to fuel your Bloodwell. As a bonus action, you can expend a Hit Die to add hit points to your Bloodwell equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
### channel divinity: *blood curse*
`2nd-LEVEL blood domain FEATURE`

As an action, you can grasp your holy symbol and force a target within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw, so long as it has blood in its veins. On a failure, it is restrained for 1 minute as its blood congeals in its body.

A restrained creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
### sanguine rebuke
`6th-LEVEL blood domain FEATURE`

Your Bloodwell rebukes those who dare to strike you. When a creature deals damage to your Bloodwell with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all of your expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### divine strike
`8th-LEVEL blood domain FEATURE`

Your god imbues your weapon attacks with divine wrath. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

At 14th level, the extra necrotic damage increases to 2d8.
### vampiric mastery
`17th-LEVEL blood domain FEATURE`

You can draw power from death. When you kill a creature with a necromancy spell of 2nd-level or higher, you can use your reaction to regain one of your expended spell slots.

The spell slot you recover must be at least one level lower than the spell you cast to kill the creature.
