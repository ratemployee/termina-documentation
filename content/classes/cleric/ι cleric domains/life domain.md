### bonus proficiency
`1st-LEVEL life domain FEATURE`

You gain proficiency with heavy armor.
### disciple of life
`1st-LEVEL life domain FEATURE`

Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st-level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
### channel divinity: *preserve life*
`2nd-LEVEL life domain FEATURE`

You can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.
### blessed healer
`6th-LEVEL life domain FEATURE`

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
### divine strike
`8th-LEVEL life domain FEATURE`

Your god imbues your weapon attacks with divine energy. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage to the target.

At 14th level, the extra radiant damage increases to 2d8.
### supreme healing
`17th-LEVEL life domain FEATURE`

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
