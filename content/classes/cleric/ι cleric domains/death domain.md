### channel divinity: *death's spirit*

You can use a bonus action to strike your weapon against your holy symbol and call upon the primordial spirit of Death itself. For 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated, die, or use a bonus action to end this effect, you are swathed in the spiritual shadow of a deathly being. Once per turn while swathed in this way, you can make an additional melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of you when you hit with a melee attack (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier.
### within death's reach

Death extends its reach through you. You gain resistance to necrotic damage.

Additionally, when you are under the effects of Death's Spirit, your spirit's reach increases by 5 feet and deals necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier.
### divine strike
`8th-LEVEL death domain FEATURE`

You can infuse your weapon strikes with the power of death. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

At 14th level, the extra necrotic damage increases to 2d8.
### death knight
`17th-LEVEL death domain FEATURE`

The touch of death infuses your body. You gain immunity to necrotic damage. In addition, while you are under the effects of Death's Spirit, you gain the benefits of the [[death ward]] spell for the feature's duration.
