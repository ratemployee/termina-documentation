#clericsubclass

> Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger the gods.

### acolyte of nature
`1st-LEVEL nature domain FEATURE`

Nature bestows secrets reserved for its defenders. You learn [[druidcraft]] and one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

You also gain proficiency with heavy armor and one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.
### channel divinity: *verdant cage*
`2nd-LEVEL nature domain FEATURE`

You can use your Channel Divinity to lock your foes within nature's grasp and your reach. As an action, you can present your holy symbol and call upon nature. Magical vines, roots, branches, or other natural matter of your choice erupt from your body, forming an immobile 10-foot radius dome centered on you, which faces in a direction you choose when you create it. The dome persists for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). A creature that would be surrounded by the dome can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, it can move up to half its speed to escape the dome.

The sphere's AC is equal to your spell save DC, and its hit points are a number equal to 5 x your cleric level; it is immune to psychic damage and all conditions. The dome provides three-quarters cover from attacks and effects that pass through it. Additionally, creatures can't pass through the dome, and ability checks made to see anything past the dome are made with disadvantage.

While the dome has hit points, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and attacks against you can't benefit from advantage.
### dampen elements
`6th-LEVEL nature domain FEATURE`

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.
### divine strike
`8th-LEVEL nature domain FEATURE`

Your god imbues your weapon attacks with the wrath of the natural world. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target.

At 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
### unstoppable nature
`17th-LEVEL nature domain FEATURE`

Nature's wrath accelerates your form. While you are concentrating on a domain spell, you can attack twice instead of once when you take the Attack action, and each of these attacks can benefit from your Divine Strike.

Additionally, you are always under the effects of the [[tree stride]] spell, and you can enter into and out of stone, mud, sand, and other natural materials in addition to trees.
