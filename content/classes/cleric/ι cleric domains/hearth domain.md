> Gods of the Hearth are patrons of all those who offer shelter to others. Clerics of the Hearth Domain are often selfless individuals that put the comfort of their companions before all else. They strive to shelter the weak and bolster the spirits of those who are weary. Hearth Clerics see themselves as the first line of defense in the cosmic battle against evildoers that seek to destroy the warm, cozy, and safe places of the world.

### bonus proficiencies
`1st-LEVEL hearth domain FEATURE`

A host has certain obligations to their guests, and you must be able to provide comfort and warmth to your friends. When you adopt this Divine Domain, you gain proficiency with the herbalism kit, cook's utensils, and with heavy armor.
### hearth's blessing
`1st-LEVEL hearth domain FEATURE`

Your presence allows your companions to rest without care. At the end of each short rest, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1). Their level of exhaustion, if any, reduced by 1, and regain (additional) hit points equal to your cleric level.

In addition, you learn the [[create bonfire]] cantrip. It counts as a cleric cantrip for you, but it does not count against your total number of Cantrips Known.
### channel divinity: *restful sojourn*
`2nd-LEVEL hearth domain FEATURE`

As an action on your turn, you can touch your holy symbol to a willing creature, causing it to fall under the effects of the [[catnap]] spell. When you cast [[catnap]] in this way, the spell has its duration reduced to 1 minute.
### selfless healer
`6th-LEVEL hearth domain FEATURE`

Your god protects you when you protect others. Whenever you cast a cleric spell that restores hit points or stabilizes a creature, you also gain the benefits of the Dodge action until the beginning of your next turn.
### divine strike
`8th-LEVEL hearth domain FEATURE`

You channel the warmth of the Hearth into your strikes. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 fire damage to the target.

At 14th level, the extra fire damage increases to 2d8.
### beacon of hospitality
`17th-LEVEL hearth domain FEATURE`

Your god has blessed you with unmatched hearty resilience. You gain resistance to fire and poison damage, and you have advantage on any saving throw you make to resist becoming frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned.
