> A reclusive Circle of Druids that often dwells on the extreme outskirts of civilization, the Circle of Regression teaches its members to devolve into an ancient, more primal form of its species. These wild warriors often embrace a primitive style of life and eschew all modern comforts of civilization. When left alone, they are no threat, but if their lands are attacked, they defend what is theirs with a wild and savage ferocity.

### primal form
`2nd-LEVEL circle of regression FEATURE`

Rather than transform into a beast, you draw on the power of nature to regress into a primitive form. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to transform into a Primal Form, which grants you the following benefits:
- You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your level.
- You can grow by one size—for example, from Medium to Large—so long as there is room for you to do so.
- You gain either a climbing speed or a swimming speed (your choice) equal to your walking speed.
- Your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage.
- Whenever you make a Strength-based ability check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Your Primal Form transformation lasts for 10 minutes, but it ends early if you become unconscious, or if you use a bonus action on your turn to revert to your normal form.
### primitive empowerment
`2nd-LEVEL circle of regression FEATURE`

You can enhance your Primal Form with powerful Druidic magic. While you are in your Primal Form, you can expend spell slots to improve yourself in the following ways:
- You can expend a spell slot as a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 5 times the slot's level.
- When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can expend a spell slot to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked back in a line 10 feet per level of the spell slot you expended.
- When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot to reduce the incoming damage by 1d8 per level of the spell slot you expended.
### unarmored defense
`2nd-LEVEL circle of regression FEATURE`

You are infused with the primal power you draw upon. When you are not wearing any armor or shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
### primal strikes
`6th-LEVEL circle of regression FEATURE`

Primal fury fuels your body. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Moreover, the damage of your unarmed strikes counts as magical for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks while you are in your Primal Form.
### alternate evolution
`10th-LEVEL circle of regression FEATURE`

Your primal power not only regresses your form, but shows you alternate paths that your species could have evolved on. When you transform into your Primal Form, you gain one of the additional benefits listed below for the duration:
#### amphibious form
Your skin becomes leathery and you grow webbing between your digits. You can breathe both air and water, and while swimming, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action and your unarmed strikes are made at advantage.

Finally, when you are underwater, you can see out to a radius of 120 feet as if you were in bright sunlight.
#### bestial flight
You sprout a pair of leathery or feathered wings. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover.
#### resilient hide
Your skin becomes gnarled and thick, possibly growing thick plates or resilient scales. You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class when using your Unarmored Defense, and whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by a total equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier.
### apex form
`14th-LEVEL circle of regression FEATURE`

You have mastered the transformation to your Primal Form. Your Primal Form transformation lasts for 1 hour, and while you are transformed into your Primal Form, you are resistant to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and your walking speed increases by 15 feet.

Finally, your unarmed strikes deal 2d8 damage while you are in your Primal Form.
