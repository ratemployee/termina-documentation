> The cyclical nature of life is a central belief of every druid, no matter their Circle. However, to members of the Circle of the Harvest, this cycle is of utmost importance. They stand as the protectors of natural law and look to destroy any who would violate the cycle of life with necromancy or other dark magic.

### druidic avenger
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the harvest FEATURE`

You have taken up the ancient mantle of the Druidic Avenger. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to transform into your Avenger Form. While in this Form, you retain your game statistics, but you gain the benefits below:
- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- So long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus: +1).
- When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus: +1).

This Form lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated or you end it as a bonus action.
### harvest scythe
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the harvest FEATURE`

Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can perform an ancient ritual to conjure a Harvest Scythe. It is a magic weapon with the finesse and versatile properties and deals 1d8 (1d10) slashing damage on a hit. This Scythe can be used as a spellcasting focus by you, and you gain the following benefits while you wield it:
- You know the [[chill touch]] cantrip. It counts as a Druid spell for you, but it doesn't count against your Cantrips Known.
- You always have [[inflict wounds]] prepared. It counts as a Druid spell for you, but it doesn't count against the total number of Druid spells you can prepare each day.
- You can cast [[inflict wounds]] at 1st-level, without expending a spell slot, a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

If you lose your Scythe, you can perform a 1-hour ritual and conjure another, and the previous Scythe turns to ash.
### extra attack
`6th-LEVEL circle of the harvest FEATURE`

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your Druid cantrips in place of one of those attacks.
### mantle of defense
`10th-LEVEL circle of the harvest FEATURE`

You can channel druidic magic to absorb incoming blows. As a reaction when you take damage in your Avenger Form, you can expend a spell slot to reduce the incoming damage by five times the level of the spell slot you expended.
### cull the unnatural
`14th-LEVEL circle of the harvest FEATURE`

Your desire to destroy the enemies of nature empowers your attacks. You add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the damage of any attacks you make with your Harvest Scythe while you are in your Avenger Form.

Finally, your ancient magic grants you resistance to unnatural powers. You gain resistance to necrotic damage when you are in your Avenger Form.
