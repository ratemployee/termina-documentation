> Few natural forces exert as much influence over mortals as the waters of the world. Rain from crops, raging storms, and winding rivers all influence the lives of mortals. Tidal druids monitor the relationship between civilization and the waters of oceans, rivers, and lakes. They are often found using the innate magic found in the waters to heal the sick, provide rest to the weary, and nurture the crops of common folk.

#### circle of the tides spells
Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### disciple of the sea
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the tides FEATURE`

Your dedication to primal waters has changed you. When you join this Circle, you gain the ability to breathe both air and water, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
### tidal aura
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the tides FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to exude a mystical watery force in a 15-foot radius. Creatures of your choice within this Aura treat it as difficult terrain. If a creature has a swimming speed, it ignores this effect.

Your Tidal Aura also enhances your healing powers. When you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature within this Tidal Aura, one target within the Aura regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1).

Your Tidal Aura lasts for 1 minute. Its effects end early if you end it as a bonus action, or if you are incapacitated.
### undertow
`6th-LEVEL circle of the tides FEATURE`

Your Tidal magic has grown in power. When you cast a spell that forces a creature in your Tidal Aura to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can empower the spell. Any creature within your Tidal Aura makes their initial saving throw against the empowered spell at disadvantage.

You can empower a spell in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### waters of life
`10th-LEVEL circle of the tides FEATURE`

You can wield the magic of primal water to rejuvenate your allies as you hinder your foes. When you activate your Tidal Aura, you gain a pool of temporary hit points equal to your Druid level + your Wisdom modifier that you can distribute to creatures of your choice within your Tidal Aura.

When your Tidal Aura ends, any remaining temporary hit points from this feature are immediately dispelled.
### master of the waves
`14th-LEVEL circle of the tides FEATURE`

Your bond with the mystical waters has reached its apex. You can cast [[control water]] at will, without expending a spell slot, so long as you target a body of water of sufficient size.

Also, the radius of your Tidal Aura increases to 30 feet, and creatures of your choice treat the area of your Tidal Aura as difficult terrain even if they have a swimming speed.
