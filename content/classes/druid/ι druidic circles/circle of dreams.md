> Druids of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids' guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary rest.

#### circle of dreams spells
Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### balm of the summer court
`2nd-LEVEL circle of dreams FEATURE`

You become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.
### lucidity
`6th-LEVEL circle of dreams FEATURE`

You learn to make real the dreams of those around you. As an action, you can touch the mind of an unconscious creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. When the creature returns to consciousness, a bit of its dreams returns with it. Until it finishes a long rest, the creature gains a special reaction that it can use to warp reality as if in a lucid dream. When the creature rolls a 1 on a d20 roll, it can use this reaction to treat the roll as a 20.

You can target a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus with this feature. If you attempt to target an additional creature beyond this limit, the creature who has possessed this special reaction the longest loses it as the new target gains it. 
### seelie serenity
`10th-LEVEL circle of dreams FEATURE`

Your balm draws calming energy from the Summer Court. The temporary hit points provided by your Balm of the Summer Court increases to 5 temporary hit points per die spent, and while a creature has these temporary hit points, it is immune to being charmed or frightened. If a creature is already charmed or frightened when it gains these temporary hit points, it can reroll its saving throw against the effect with advantage.
### dreamscape
`14th-LEVEL circle of dreams FEATURE`

Your foray into a creature's dreams allows you to recreate them in the world around the dreamer. When you use your Lucidity feature, you can cast [[hallucinatory terrain]] as a part of the action, but the spell's duration is reduced to 1 hour. When you do so, the spell's area is centered on the target of your Lucidity, it moves with the creature, and the creature can use an action to change its appearance using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion, provided that it can see the illusion.

In addition, for the spell's duration, the target gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, it has advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws, and it regains 2 hit points for every 1 hit point it would normally regain.

The first time you cast [[hallucinatory terrain]] in this way, you can do so without expending a spell slot. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
