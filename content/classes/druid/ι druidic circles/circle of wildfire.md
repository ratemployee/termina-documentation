> Druids of the Circle of Wildfire understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, such as when a forest fire promoted later growth, and that entropy is the base of the universe. These druids draw energy from entropy, releasing it as cleansing fire to bring new life in destructive wake.

#### circle of wildfire spells
Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### fire form
`2nd-LEVEL circle of wildfire FEATURE`

You can release stored entropy in a disseminating wave like the origin of a fire. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to take on your Fire Form, rather than transforming into a beast, for 1 minute. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, or die.

While in your fire form, you retain your game statistics, but you are enflamed and an aura of fire burns away from you. When you activate this feature, the aura extends to a range of 10 feet, and the aura increases in radius by 5 feet at the start of each of your turns.

The aura sheds bright light within its radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Any creature of your choice who starts its turn within your aura must make a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d6 + half your druid level. In addition, when you target a creature within your aura with a spell that restores hit points, the creature regains an additional 1d6 hit points.
### burn barrier
`6th-LEVEL circle of wildfire FEATURE`

You learn to sculpt the flames within your Fire Form aura. When you activate your Fire Form, and as a bonus action while it's present, you can enflame any creature within your aura while it remains in your aura. While enflamed, a creature has resistance to fire damage, and it deals an extra 1d8 damage when it deals fire damage once per turn.
### rising flame
`10th-LEVEL circle of wildfire FEATURE`

You gain a flying speed of 10 feet while in your Fire Form, and can hover. In addition, your aura begins at 15 feet, instead of 10 feet, and enflamed creatures regain 2d6 hit points when targeted with a healing spell, instead of 1d6.
### stoke
`14th-LEVEL circle of wildfire FEATURE`

Life grows rapidly in the wake of your flames. As an action while in your Fire Form, you can stoke your flames. Each enflamed creature in the aura regains 4d6 hit points, and any creature that is not enflamed must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes your Fire Form's damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded.

Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you use your Wild Shape to enter your Fire Form again.
