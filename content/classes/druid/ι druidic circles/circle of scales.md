> While most druids protect places of natural power or wield the forces of nature, some form Circles in service of ancient dragons. In an effort to defend their lair, elder dragons will bestow some of their power upon druids who maintain its territory. The older the dragon, the larger its Druidic Circle.

#### circle of scales spells
Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### draconic wild shape
`2nd-LEVEL circle of scales FEATURE`

The draconic power you have been gifted allows you to adopt more powerful beast forms. As a bonus action, you can use Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a Challenge Rating as high as 1. You can ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but you must abide by all other limitations.

Also, when you Wild Shape to transform into a beast, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to empower your transformation with the draconic magic of your Circle, granting your beast form the following additional benefits:
- The beast is covered in a thin sheen of draconic scales that resemble those of the dragon you serve. The bast's Armor Class is equal to 13 + its Dexterity modifier, unless its natural Armor Class was already higher.
- The beast gains resistance to the damage type associated with the Element of the elder dragon you serve.
- The beast gains temporary hit points equal to five times the level of the spell slot you used to empower this form.
- As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to grant your beast form temporary hit points equal to five times the level of the spell slot you expend.

Once you empower your Wild Shape in this way, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.
### infused strikes
`6th-LEVEL circle of scales FEATURE`

When you empower your Wild Shape transformation with draconic magic, your beast's natural weapon attacks deal the damage type of your dragon's Element.

In addition, you can now Wild Shape into a beast with a CR as high as your Druid level divided by 3, rounded down.
### terrifying wild shape
`10th-LEVEL circle of scales FEATURE`

Your mastery over the draconic magic you wield allows you to take on the form of a true dragon. As a bonus action, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to take the form of a dragon with a CR of 5 or lower.

If you use Wild Shape into a dragon with a breath weapon, you can choose for its breath weapon to deal the damage type of your elder dragon's Element in place of the normal damage.
### elder power
`14th-LEVEL circle of scales FEATURE`

You have become one of the most loyal servants of your elder dragon and are given increased power. When you empower your Wild Shape transformation with draconic magic, the beast sprouts a leathery pair of draconic wings and gains a 40-foot flying or swimming speed (your choice).
