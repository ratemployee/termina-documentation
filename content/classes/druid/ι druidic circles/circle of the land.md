> Druids of the Circle of the Land are the most common druid, if druids can be considered common at all. These sages of the natural world are able to attune themselves to almost any environment, giving them an increased ability to draw out the natural magic of the flora and fauna that surround them.

#### localized spells
You have mastered a greater amount of druidic magic. You learn one additional Druid cantrip of your choice, but it does not count against your total number of Cantrips Known.

In addition, you are infused with the ability to cast certain spells based on your environment. When you finish a long rest, you can attune to the local environment, choosing the option that best represents your surroundings: arctic, cave, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp.

While attuned to that environment, you gain access to the corresponding spells on the Localized Spells table below. These spells count as Druid spells for you, and you always have them prepared, but they don't count against the total number of Druid spells that you can prepare each day.

### natural recovery
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the land FEATURE`

You can regain some of your druidic magic by communing with nature. At the end of a short rest, you can choose to recover a number of expended spell slots with a combined level less than or equal to your Druid level (rounded up). Spell slots you regain must be 5th-level or lower.

Once you use this feature to recover spell slots, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
### acolyte of nature
`6th-LEVEL circle of the land FEATURE`

You move effortlessly through the wild. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain imposed by your attuned environment.

Moreover, you have advantage on saving throws to resist the harmful effects of your attuned environment. Examples include extreme temperatures and weather, hostile flora, or other magical environmental effects.
### nature's ward
`10th-LEVEL circle of the land FEATURE`

You are able to adapt to the hostile effects of nearly any wild place. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. You gain resistance to that type of damage until the end of your next short or long rest.
### nature's sanctuary
`14th-LEVEL circle of the land FEATURE`

Creatures of the natural world can sense your devotion to nature and are hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant attacks you, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the attack automatically misses. On a success, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Beasts and plants with a Wisdom of 4 or higher are aware of this effect before they make their attack against you.
