> The Druid Circle that is most revered by civilized peoples is that of the Sowers. Folktales tell of an ancient druidic sage that guided mortals to the discovery of agriculture. Drawing on their mystical knowledge of the natural world, this druid led ancient peoples to establish the first farms and towns. Those who join the Circle of the Sower follow the example of that ancient sage. They wander the countryside and offer magical aid to farmers, gardeners, all who till the soil.

#### circle of the sower spells
Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### mystic harvest
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the sower FEATURE`

You learn to use druidic magic to produce wondrous fruits. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to produce one Mystical Fruit from the list below in your empty hand. The Fruit can be eaten as an action. Any uneaten Fruit spoils after 1 minute.

$\quad$ `Invigorating Fruit.` The creature that eats this Fruit regains hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Druid level. Any hit points over its hit point maximum become temporary hit points.

$\quad$ `Mystic Fruit.` The creature that eats this Fruit regains a single expended spell slot of a level equal to your Wisdom modifier or lower. Once a creature benefits from this Fruit, it must complete a long rest before it can do so again.

$\quad$ `Revitalizing Fruit.` The creature that eats this Fruit is instantly cured of one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, a reduction to an ability score or its hit point maximum, or its exhaustion is reduced by 1.
### wandering sage
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the sower FEATURE`

You gain a mystical understanding of the natural cycles of life, growth, and death. You gain proficiency in Nature. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Nature) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus: +1).
### wild growth
`6th-LEVEL circle of the sower FEATURE`

You cause plants to blossom and thrive wherever you travel. When you take a short or long rest, the effects of the 8-hour casting of [[plant growth]] immediately take effect in the area around you, unless you choose to withhold them.

Your connection with plant life also grants you immunity to poison damage, the poisoned condition, and natural poisons.
### abundant harvest
`10th-LEVEL circle of the sower FEATURE`

You can use the magic of your Wild Shape to produce more potent produce. When you produce a Mystic Fruit, you can choose from the following additional options:

$\quad$ `Emboldening Fruit.` The next time the creature that eats this Fruit rolls a d20, it can choose to substitute its d20 roll with your Druid level.

$\quad$ `Primal Fruit.` The creature that eats this Fruit is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the next minute.
### verdant grasp
`14th-LEVEL circle of the sower FEATURE`

You have an unparalleled command over plant life. You can cast [[grasping vine]] without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you cast [[grasping vine]], you can conjure two vines at once in separate locations within range of the spell. You can direct both vines at once with the same bonus action.
