> Deep in the unexplored jungles of the world, lizardfolk tribes are led by a fearsome Circle of Druids that worship ancient reptiles known as dinosaurs. Members of this Circle draw upon the memory of these ancient beasts that flows within their own blood to strike fear into the hearts of their foes.

#### circle of the ancients spells
Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| **Druid Level** | **Spells**              |
| :-------------: | ----------------------- |
|       2nd       | [[cause fear]]          |
|       3rd       | [[enlarge-reduce]]      |
|       5th       | [[fear]]                |

### ancient forms
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the ancients FEATURE`

Whether by heritage or ceremony, your bloodline now bears the memory of ancient dinosaurs. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to take the form of a dinosaur or another reptilian beast with a Challenge Rating as high as 1. You can ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but you must abide by all other limitations.

You do not need to have seen a dinosaur before to Wild Shape into it. However, you are limited to Wild Shaping only into dinosaurs and their descendants: birds and reptiles. Examples include velociraptors, crocodiles, and vultures.

At 6th level, you can Wild Shape into an Ancient Form with a CR as high as your Druid level divided by 3, rounded down.
### primitive adaptation
`2nd-LEVEL circle of the ancients FEATURE`

Your fingers elongate into savage claws which count as natural weapons and deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
### primal strikes
`6th-LEVEL circle of the ancients FEATURE`

You have learned to draw forth more of the ancient power in your blood. Your natural weapon attacks in your normal form and Ancient Form attacks count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
### dreadful wild shape
`10th-LEVEL circle of the ancients FEATURE`

Your connection with the great reptiles of ancient days grows stronger. As a bonus action, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape to transform into an Ancient Form with a CR equal to your Druid level divided by 2, rounded down.
### monstrous form
`14th-LEVEL circle of the ancients FEATURE`

You can enhance your Ancient Form with druidic power. While in Ancient Form, you can cast the *enlarge* portion of [[enlarge-reduce]], targeting only yourself, without expending a spell slot or material components.

You can cast [[enlarge-reduce]] in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
