### rage
You fight with an unchecked primal ferocity in battle. Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to enter a Rage. While your Rage lasts, you gain all the benefits listed below, so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor:
- You have advantage on any Constitution checks, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws that you make.
- When you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack, you deal a bonus 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. As you gain levels in this class, this damage bonus increases to match the Exploit Die Size column on the Barbarian table.
- You resist all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- You cannot cast spells or concentrate on spells or effects.

Your Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, but it ends early if you become unconscious. You can extend your Rage to the end of your next turn by attacking a creature, taking damage, making a Strength check, or using a bonus action to extend it. You can maintain your Rage for up to 10 minutes.

Once you enter a Rage, you must finish a short or long rest before you can Rage again. As you gain levels in this class, you can Rage additional times between each short or long rest, as shown in the Rages column on the Barbarian table.
### unarmored defense
Also at 1st level, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
### danger sense
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
### reckless attack
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

In addition, you have advantage on your initiative rolls. If you are surprised when you roll initiative you can act normally so long as you Rage as part of your first turn.
### savage exploits
Also at 2nd level, you have gained savage abilities that enhance your martial skill on and off the battlefield.
#### exploit dice
The Barbarian table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform any Exploits you know. Most Exploits require you to expend these Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Exploit Dice begins as d4s and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Barbarian table.
#### exploits known
You learn two [[primal exploits]]. The Exploits Known column of the Barbarian table shows when you learn additional Exploits. To learn an Exploit, you must meet any prerequisites that it may have, like a minimum ability score or Barbarian level.

Each time you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of the Savage Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice, so long as you meet that Exploit's prerequisites.
#### saving throws
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

$\quad$ **Exploit save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
### primal path
At 3rd level, you choose the Primal Path that best represents your Barbarian's style of combat and the source of your Primal Rage:

- [[path of beauty]]
- [[path of the berserker]]
- [[path of the brute]]
- [[path of the champion]]
- [[path of the conduit]]
- [[path of the deep]]
- [[path of the favored]]
- [[path of the inferno]]
- [[path of the lycan]]
- [[path of the mutant]]
- [[path of the packleader]]
- [[path of the storm]]
- [[path of the titan]]
- [[path of the warden]]
- [[path of the wilder]]
- [[path of the wildheart]]
- [[path of the wyrmblood]]
- [[path of the zealot]]
- [[path of wild sorcery]]

Your choice of specialization grants features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 6th, 10th, and 14th level in this class.
### primal knowledge
When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.
#### path exploits
Some Primal Paths have a list of Path Exploits that you learn at the Barbarian levels noted in that Primal Path description. They don't count against your number of Exploits Known and cannot be switched out for other Exploits. If you do not meet a Path Exploit's prerequisites, you learn it regardless.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### extra attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
### feral instinct
The primal fury that fuels your Rage in battle also hones your senses. Upon reaching 7th level, your Rage lasts for its maximum duration, and only ends early if you become unconscious or you choose to end it. 
### brutal critical
Primal fury increases the power of your strikes. Beginning at 9th level, attack rolls for your Strength-based weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. At certain Barbarian levels your critical hit range increases: at 13th level you score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20, and at 17th level you score a critical hit on a roll of 17-20.
### critical strike
You ruthlessly exploit the weakness of your foes. Starting at 11th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack while you are Raging, you can use a Savage Exploit you know as part of that attack without expending an Exploit Die.
### relentless rage
The white hot fury of your Rage burns ever brighter. Also at 11th level you gain the following benefits while Raging: 
- If you drop to 0 hit points, but do not die outright, you can choose to end your Rage to drop to 1 hit point instead. 
- When you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum bonus: +1).
### persistent rage
You have mastered your Rage, becoming one with your anger. Beginning at 15th level, when you Rage, it lasts for 1 hour.
### indomitable might
Your physical power and stamina rival the heroes of legend. Starting at 18th level, if you make a Strength or Constitution check and the result of your roll is lower than your Strength score, you can use your Strength score in place of the result.
### primal champion
You embody the raw power of the primal wilderness and have exceeded the physical limits of normal mortals. At 20th level, both your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, and your maximum for both of those scores is now 24.
