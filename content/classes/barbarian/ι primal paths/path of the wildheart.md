> Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wildheart learn to bind themselves to primal bestial spirits of the natural world. Drawing upon this animalistic power, these warriors are able to take on the spiritual and physical abilities of these bestial spirits. Wildhearts often serve as protectors of the wilds and have a special dedication to the beasts of the wilderness.
