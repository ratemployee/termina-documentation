> Not all who have psionic potential learn to control their inner wondrous power. Some who repress the mystical powers of their mind inadvertently discover their true potential when they give over to the fury of their Rage. Combining unrealized psionic potential and primal anger, these Wilder Barbarians are a terrible sight to behold on the field of battle.

#### wilder exploits
You learn certain Exploits at the Barbarian levels noted in the table below. These don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched upon gaining a level.

| **Barbarian Level** | **Exploit**                            |
| :-----------------: | -------------------------------------- |

### psionic instinct
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE WILDER FEATURE`

The untapped psionic potential of your mind gives you subtle benefits. Whenever you are forced to make a saving throw to resist being charmed, frightened, or have your thoughts read, you can add your Constitution modifier to your roll.

Also, you can add your proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.
### wilder surge
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE WILDER FEATURE`

Your fury unleashes your untamed psionic potential. When you Rage, roll on the Wilder Surge table to determine the psionic effect produced, which lasts for the duration of your Rage. If the Wilder Surge effect requires a saving throw, it uses your Exploit save DC.

### telekinetic grasp
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WILDER FEATURE`

Your desire to draw your enemies toward you awakens your psionic abilities. As a bonus action, you can force a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, the creature is pulled toward you in a straight line, up to 30 feet. A creature that is one size larger then you or larger has advantage on its Strength saving throw to resist this ability. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all of expended uses each time you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend an Exploit Die to use this feature again.
### controlled psionics
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WILDER FEATURE`

The savagery of your fury allows you to exert control over your psionic abilities. When you roll on the Wilder Surge table you can roll twice and choose the result. 

In addition, when you succeed on a saving throw that gains your Psionic Instinct bonus, you can use your reaction to deal psychic damage equal to your Barbarian level to the creature that forced you to make that saving throw.
### greater telekinesis
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WILDER FEATURE`

You are able to channel your psionic power with ease. When you Rage, you can use Telekinetic Grasp as part of the same bonus action, without expending a use of that feature. 

Moreover, if the creature you pull ends its movement within range of a melee weapon you are wielding, you can make one melee attack against it as part of that same bonus action.
