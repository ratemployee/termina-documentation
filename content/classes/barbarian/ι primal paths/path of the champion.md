> At the front of every great fighting force stands a Champion. These elite warriors are masters of battle who stand as paragons of honorable combat and fair play. Often, they seek out the most powerful of their foes and look to swiftly end conflicts with honorable duels or athletic competitions.

### fighting style
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE CHAMPION FEATURE`

You supplement your Rage with martial training. You learn a Fighting Style from the list below. You can't learn a Fighting Style more than once, even if you gain this feature again.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can switch your Fighting Style for another option from the list below:

$\quad$ `Dual Wielding.` When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make the single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your Attack action instead of your bonus action, and you add your ability modifier to the damage.

$\quad$ `Great Weapon Fighting.` Whenever you make an attack with a heavy melee weapon as part of your Attack action, you can treat a total roll of 5 or lower on the weapon's damage dice as a 6. You must be wielding the weapon with two hands.

$\quad$ `Improvised Fighting.` You gain proficiency with improvised weapons, and when you use an object to make an improvised weapon attack, you can roll the damage die twice and take the higher roll. When you do, the object is destroyed and cannot be used for further attacks. You can't use this feature to destroy magical objects.

$\quad$ `Strongbow.` You can use your Strength modifier, in place of Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with longbows and shortbows. When you do so, you gain a +1 to damage rolls with those weapons.

$\quad$ `Thrown Weapon Fighting.` You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. Moreover, when you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll of that attack.

$\quad$ `Versatile Fighting.` While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls with that weapon. While doing so, you can also use your bonus action to make a grapple or shove attack, or take the Use an Object action.
### martial training
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE CHAMPION FEATURE`

Your combat training enhances the potency of your Rage. Your total number of Exploit Dice increases by one. Also, whenever you use a Savage Exploit while Raging, the size of your Exploit Die increases by 1, to a maximum of a d12.
### mighty blow
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE CHAMPION FEATURE`

You can focus the full might of your Rage into a single mighty blow. When you hit a creature with a Strength-based weapon attack while you are Raging, you can instantly end your Rage and turn that attack into an automatic critical hit.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.
### peak athlete
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE CHAMPION FEATURE`

Your physical abilities become peerless. You gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and when you enter a Rage, you gain the benefits of the Dash action.
### invigorating critical
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE CHAMPION FEATURE`

Landing a solid strike on a foe renews your will to fight. Whenever you score a critical hit with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can regain hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1 hit point).
### survivor
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE CHAMPION FEATURE`

You become a nearly perfect physical specimen and have become exceedingly hard to kill. Whenever you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1 temporary hit point).
