### gift of the depths
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE DEEP FEATURE`

You have been irreparably changed by your exposure to the mysterious depths. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and you can breathe both air and water.
### otherworldly grasp
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE DEEP FEATURE`

Your eldritch power becomes apparent when you Rage. Whenever you Rage, you instantly manifest one additional appendage, the appearance of which reflects the nature of the being which infused you with otherworldly eldritch power. Your eldritch appendage lasts for the duration of your Rage, and can be attacked as part of you. 

As a bonus action, you can use this appendage to force a target you can see within 15 feet to make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, it is pulled up to 15 feet toward you. Any target larger than you has advantage on its Strength saving throw.
### reality warp
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE DEEP FEATURE`

Your mind-altering experiences allow you to identify, and slip through, the cracks in reality. As an action, you can teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. This does not provoke opportunity attacks. Immediately before, or after, you do so, you can make one attack as part of the same action. 

When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature as part of the bonus action you use to enter a Rage. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend an Exploit Die to use this feature again.
### eldritch tendrils
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE DEEP FEATURE`

The strange eldritch power inside you allows your body to mutate further. When you Rage, you manifest two additional appendages which last until the end of your Rage.

As a bonus action, you can cause both of your appendages to use Otherworldly Grasp, or grapple a creature you can see within 15 feet. Each of your appendages can target the same, or different, creatures. If they target the same creature, the target has disadvantage on its saving throw (Otherworldly Grasp) or ability check (grapple). Each appendage can use the same, or a different feature as part of the same bonus action.

When you reach 14th level in this class, the range of your additional appendage abilities increases to 20 feet.
### the horrors below
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE DEEP FEATURE`

When you travel through the cracks in reality, you can reveal the eldritch horrors beyond this world. When you use Reality Warp, you can force creatures within 10 feet of the point you appear to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, creatures take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit die and are frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, creatures take half as much psychic damage and are not frightened of you.

Creatures that are immune to the frightened condition automatically succeed on the saving throw and take no damage.
