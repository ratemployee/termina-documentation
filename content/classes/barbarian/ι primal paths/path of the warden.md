> Hailing from the wild places of the world where the primal power of nature reigns supreme, Barbarians that follow the Path of the Warden are servants of the natural order. They use the raw power of their Rage to channel spirits found throughout the natural world. They often serve as the defenders of sacred groves, Druidic Circles, and other places of natural power.

### primal magic
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE WARDEN FEATURE`

When you adopt this Primal Path, you learn to cast powerful primal spells.
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[warden spell list]]. At 10th level in this class, you learn one additional Warden cantrip of your choice.
#### spell slots
The Warden Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of the Warden spells you know of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots each time you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [[thunderwave]], you must spend one of those slots, and cast it as a 2nd-level spell.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[warden spell list]]. The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Warden spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. 

When you gain a level, you can choose a Warden spell you know and replace it with another spell from the [[warden spell list]], which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting ability
As you draw your magic from your connection to primal spirits, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Warden spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell, or when making an attack roll with one.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### primal rage
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE WARDEN FEATURE`

You have learned to draw on primal magic, even in your Rage. You can cast Warden spells when you're Raging, but you have disadvantage on any Constitution saving throws you make to maintain concentration on your Warden spells while Raging.

Also, casting a Warden spell of 1st-level or higher allows your Rage to continue until the end of your next turn, even if you don't meet the other requirements to extend your Rage.
### guardian's fury
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WARDEN FEATURE`

You can ruthlessly weave minor spells with weapon attacks. When you use your action to cast a Warden spell, you can make a weapon attack as a bonus action on that turn. 

Moreover, you can use Reckless Attack when you cast a Warden spell that requires a spell attack roll.
### ward of the ancients
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WARDEN FEATURE`

Your connection with the natural world shields you from magic. As a reaction when you would take damage from a spell, you can expend a Primal Magic spell slot to grant yourself resistance to all damage from the triggering spell.
### improved guardian's fury
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WARDEN FEATURE`

Your Rage and connection with primal spirits have fused to become something that rivals the great destructive forces of nature. When you take the Attack action while Raging, you can cast a Warden spell in place of one of your attacks. 

Finally, you no longer have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws you make to maintain your concentration on your Warden Spells while you are Raging.
