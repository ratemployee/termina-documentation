> Across the lower planes, the eternal conflict between law and chaos rages. Devils against demons, vying for control of the hells. Sometimes this conflict spills over into the Material Plane, and the corrupting influence of the Abyss infects the hearts of mortals. Sometimes cultists and worshipers of Archdemons seek the affliction of this overwhelming power.

### abyssal hide
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE INFERNO FEATURE`

The corruption of the Abyss overtakes you when you Rage, causing your physical features to become demonic. When you are Raging, you gain the following benefits:
- As a bonus action, you can move up to your full speed toward a hostile creature that you can see.
- When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack, you can reduce the damage by your Constitution modifier. 
### hellish presence
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE INFERNO FEATURE`

When you adopt this Primal Path, you learn to speak, read, and write Abyssal, the demonic language of the Abyss.

Moreover, whenever you use [[commanding presence]], you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending an Exploit Die.
### unbridled fury
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE INFERNO FEATURE`

The chaos of the Abyss enhances your Rage. The first time you make a Reckless Attack on your turn while Raging, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points vanish when your Rage ends.
### corrupt resilience
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE INFERNO FEATURE`

The sinister power of the Abyss has increased your physical resilience. You gain resistance to both fire and poison damage.

Also, when you are forced to make a saving throw to resist either the charmed or frightened condition, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### chaos overwhelming
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE INFERNO FEATURE`

You can draw out the full power of the Abyssal influence that fuels your Rage. When you Rage, you gain one of the abilities below for the duration of that Rage. As a bonus action while you are Raging, you can expend an Exploit Die switch your current ability to another one.

$\quad$ `Accursed Reach.` Your limbs become unnaturally muscular and lengthen. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action, and the reach of your melee weapon attacks and grapples increases by 5 feet.

$\quad$ `Defiled Hide.` Your skin becomes blighted and covered in coarse hair, boils, or oily scales. You gain immunity to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons. Any attacks made with silvered weapons ignores this special damage immunity.

$\quad$ `Hulking Form.` Your body bulges and grows in unnatural ways. You grow by one size category as if you had been the target of an [[enlarge-reduce]] spell. While enlarged in this way, you can add your Consitution modifier to Strength checks.

$\quad$ `Vile Flight.` You sprout leathery demonic wings from your back which burst through any clothing you are wearing. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
