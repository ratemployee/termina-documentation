> While most barbarians hail from the wild places of the world, brutes discovered their rage in the underbelly of civilization. Their abilities stem from a combination of street smarts and pure grit. All those who follow this Path share one thing in common: they prefer to solve their problems with their fists.

#### brutish exploits
You learn certain Exploits at the Barbarian levels noted in the table below. These don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched upon gaining a level.

| **Barbarian Level** | **Exploit**                                |
| :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------ |
|         3rd         | [[commanding presence]], [[crushing grip]] |
|         5th         | [[concussive blow]], [[greater hurl]]      |
|         9th         | [[confounding critical]]                   |

### the wrong crowd
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE BRUTE FEATURE`

You learn to fall in with the roughest crowds in any given place. When you spend a night carousing in a settlement, you have advantage on all ability checks made to gather information on that settlement, its culture, factions, and any important, infamous, or influential figures.
### unarmed and dangerous
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE BRUTE FEATURE`

Your body becomes a deadly weapon. Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

In addition, whenever you take the Attack action while you are Raging and you make only unarmed strikes, grapples, or shove attacks, you can make one additional unarmed strike, grapple, or shove attack as a bonus action on that turn.
### brutal strikes
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE BRUTE FEATURE`

While Raging, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to nonmagical attacks.

Also, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can use [[concussive blow]] without expending an Exploit Die.

You can use [[concussive blow]] in this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### iron grip
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE BRUTE FEATURE`

Once you get your hands on something, it is nearly impossible for it to escape. While you are Raging, you can grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than you, and your walking speed is no longer halved when you are dragging a grappled creature.

You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
### brutish determination
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE BRUTE FEATURE`

You can shrug off physical blows that would devastate lesser warriors. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or death saving throw, you roll a d4 and add it to your roll.

Should you roll a 20 or higher on a death saving throw, you instantly regain consciousness and stand up with 1 hit point.
