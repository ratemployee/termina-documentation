### draconic fury
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE WYRMBLOOD FEATURE`

The power of your draconic blood manifests itself in your fury. You gain the following benefits while you are Raging:
- You manifest draconic scales that grant you a +2 bonus to your Armor Class while using your Unarmored Defense.
- Your Rage damage bonus and your Savage Exploits deal your Element damage in place of their normal damage.
- Once per turn when you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can roll two dice for your Rage damage bonus.
### tyrannical resilience
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WYRMBLOOD FEATURE`

Your blood protects you from magical effects. When you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against magic while Raging, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### breath of the dragon
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WYRMBLOOD FEATURE`

The magic of your bloodline allows you to exhale great blasts of draconic energy. As an action, you can force creatures in an adjacent 30-foot cone to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Exploit save DC. Creatures take 8d6 damage of your Element damage type on a failed save, and half as much damage of your Element's type on a successful save.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses left, you can expend a use of your Rage to use this feature again.
### draconic wings
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE WYRMBLOOD FEATURE`

You manifest the full power of your draconic bloodline. As a bonus action, you can manifest a pair of draconic wings. These wings grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and last until you dismiss them as a bonus action. 

Clothing that is not made to accommodate your wings is destroyed when you manifest them.
