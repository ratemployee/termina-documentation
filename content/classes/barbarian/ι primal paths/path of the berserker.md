> The savage warriors known as berserkers live for the chaos of battle. For these barbarians, their rage is a manifestation of their lust for violence and destruction. Often found on the front lines of battle, berserkers only feel fully alive when they are risking life and limb to test their might against their foes.

### frenzy
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE BERSERKER FEATURE`

Your fury in battle surpasses that of even other barbarians, making you a terror to behold. The first time you hit with a Strength-based weapon attack on your turn, you deal bonus damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die.

Your fury also propels you headlong into battle. While you are Raging, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
### mindless rage
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE BERSERKER FEATURE`

You lose yourself in your wild rage. You can't be charmed or frightened while Raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you Rage, the effect is suspended for the duration.

Moreover, while you are Raging, you can ignore the effects of the first five levels of exhaustion that you have.
### intimidating presence
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE BERSERKER FEATURE`

Your presence begins to inspire fear. You can use [[menacing shout]] without expending an Exploit Die a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.

If you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on the same turn that you use [[menacing shout]], that creature has disadvantage on its saving throw against [[menacing shout]].
### unrivaled fury
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE BERSERKER FEATURE`

The fury you direct at your foes in battle is unrivaled. You can use [[savage rebuke]] at will, without expending an Exploit Die.
