> Some Barbarians draw their Rage from their ancestry. Those who walk the Path of the Titan fuel their Rage with the giant blood that flows in their veins. While some Titanic warriors are direct descendants of giants, some are unaware of their heritage until it manifests with their Rage. Often unusually tall or strong for their race, mortals with giant blood in their veins are fairly obvious.

### fury of the titans
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE TITAN FEATURE`

The fury of your Rage draws out the ancient power of your bloodline. When you Rage, you gain the following benefits:
- If there is room, you can choose to grow by one size category for the duration of that Rage. For example, you grow from Medium to Large. Your physical size doubles in all dimensions, and your weight is multipled by eight.
- Your Strength-based weapon attacks deal bonus damage depending on your current size: Medium (1d4), Large (1d6), Huge (1d12), and Gargantuan (2d12).
- You can use [[hurl]] without expending an Exploit Die.
### titanic vitality
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE TITAN FEATURE`

Your Rage draws out an ever-increasing amount of resilience from the power that flows in your blood. When you Rage, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Barbarian level.
### awakened bloodline
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE TITAN FEATURE`

The power dormant within your blood is apparent even when not drawn out by your Rage. You manifest more specific traits dependent upon your Giant Bloodline, as detailed below:
#### lesser giant
Your appearance becomes knotted and grotesque. When you make a Strength (Intimidation) or a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die. Moreover, your strange knotted flesh grants you a +1 bonus to your Armor Class while you are Raging.
#### hill giant
Your body has grown strangely resilient. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws, and when you take damage while Raging, you can use a reaction to reduce the damage you take by your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1).
#### stone giant
You have become especially observant and thoughtful. You gain proficiency in Insight, and when you make a Wisdom (Insight) check you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die. Moreover, when you are forced to make a Wisdom saving throw while Raging, you gain a bonus to your saving throw roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
#### frost giant
You are ruthless in war. When you use an Exploit that deals damage, you can cause it to deal cold damage. Also, each time you hit a target with an attack while Raging, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
#### fire giant
You have begun to embody the cruelty of the fire giants. While you are wearing armor you can use your Constitution modifier, in place of Dexterity, to calculate your Armor Class. Also, when a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are Raging, you can use your reaction to deal fire damage to the attacker equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
#### cloud giant
You have become more whimsical and lighthearted. You gain resistance to falling damage, and while you are Raging, you can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action.
#### storm giant
You have grown in pride and presence. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe both air and water. Also, while you are Raging, you can cause your thrown weapon attacks and both [[hurl]] and [[greater hurl]] to deal lighting damage in place of their normal damage.
### titanic wrath
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE TITAN FEATURE`

You learn to strike with the power of a true giant. When you take the Attack action while Raging, you can focus all your power into one strike. You make one attack for this action, even if you have a feature that lets you make more than one attack. On a hit, it becomes a critical hit, regardless of your attack roll.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
