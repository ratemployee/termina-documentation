> Wild warriors all, Barbarians fight with a primal ferocity not seen in civilized soldiers. For some, this savage spirit calls out to the beasts of the wild, and a bond is forged. Known as Packleaders, these primal warriors fight side by side with a Savage Companion, hunting their foes in deadly tandem.

### beast whisperer
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE PACKLEADER FEATURE`

You have a special way of connecting with beasts of the wild. You gain proficiency in Animal Handling, and when you make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check related to wild animals, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to a roll of your Exploit Die.
### savage companion
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE PACKLEADER FEATURE`

You have forged a primal bond with a wild beast known as a Savage Companion. You determine its appearance, but this choice has no effect on its game statistics. Common Savage Companions are wolves, boars, bears, wildcats, and hyenas. Your Companion is friendly to you and your allies, and obeys your commands. It uses the Savage Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, your Savage Companion acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another action.

When you take the Attack action, you can command your Companion to take the Attack action in place of one attack. If you are incapacitated, your Companion acts on its own.

If your Companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. If your Savage Companion dies, you can spend time during a long rest to seek out a worthy beast from the wild to serve as your Companion, so long as such a beast exists. Once you bond with such a beast, it uses the Savage Companion stat block.

> 
> `Maul.` *Melee Weapon Attack:* + 2 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d8 + 2 + PB slashing damage.
### wild fury
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE PACKLEADER FEATURE`

Your fury begins to infect your Savage Companion. When you Rage, your Companion also gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the duration.
### leader of the pack
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE PACKLEADER FEATURE`

You and your Companion learn to fight as one in battle. Both you and your Savage Companion have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if the other is within 5 feet of the target creature and they are not incapacitated.
### primal howl
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE PACKLEADER FEATURE`

Your savage spirit rivals the greatest predators of the wild. When you Rage, either you or your Savage Companion can let forth a primal howl, and force creatures of your choice that can hear it within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, it is frightened of whoever howled for 1 minute. 

A creature can repeat this saving throw at the start of each turn, ending the effect on a success. A target that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effects of this howl for the next 24 hours.
