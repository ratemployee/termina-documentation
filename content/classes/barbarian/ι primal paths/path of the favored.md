> For most barbarians, their Rage is drawn from their lust for battle or a desire for revenge, but for others, their Rage is a gift. Warriors who walk the Path of the Favored receive their Rage from an outside source. Some are blessed by fate to be mighty warriors, others are the scions of gods or Archfey, and others still may be the descendants of legendary adventurers.

> Whatever the source of your supernatural blessing, you have a knack for finding success when others would surely fail, turning bitter enemies into stout allies, and overcoming obstacles that would seem impossible to all but you.

#### favored exploits
You learn certain Exploits at the Barbarian levels noted in the table below. These don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched upon gaining a level.

| **Barbarian Level** | **Exploit**                                |
| :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------ |
|         3rd         | [[feat of strength]], [[heroic fortitude]] |
|         5th         | [[ringing critical]], [[thunderous blow]]  |
|         9th         | [[mythic athleticism]]                     |

### favored presence
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE FAVORED FEATURE`

You learn that there is something about your physicality that makes others view you more favorably. When you meet a creature for the first time, its starting attitude is one level higher than normal. For example, a hostile creature would view you indifferently, or a creature that would view you indifferently may consider you friendly. 

This feature has no effect on those you travel with.
### touched by fate
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE FAVORED FEATURE`

An outside force blesses you to succeed, especially in battle. When you are Raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you roll a 1 on an Exploit Die, you can roll it again. You must keep the new roll, even if it's another 1.
- When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result of the roll to your Armor Class against the triggering attack.
- When you miss with a Strength-based weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result of your roll to your attack roll for that attack.
### glorious cause
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE FAVORED FEATURE`

Your near-supernatural ability to succeed motivates all who follow you into battle. When you Rage, roll an Exploit Die. You, and a number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet up to your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1 creature), gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + your Exploit Die roll.
### tireless hero
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE FAVORED FEATURE`

Whatever the source of your favor, it has empowered you to find success where others would fail. When you use [[feat of strength]], you can roll a d4 and add it to your roll instead of expending an Exploit Die.

At 14th level in this class, this bonus becomes a d6.
### wondrous success
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE FAVORED FEATURE`

You learn to channel the supernatural power that guides your favored path through life. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to use your Barbarian level in place of the d20 roll. You can use this feature after you roll, but before you know if your ability check, attack roll, or saving throw succeeds or fails.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
### strength overwhelming
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE FAVORED FEATURE`

You become something more than mortal, and are able to perform feats of supernatural strength that rivals the great heroes of legend. You learn [[strength of the colossus]], but it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known. When you use [[strength of the colossus]], you calculate the base amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift as if you had spent one additional Exploit Die (maximum of 6).

If you already know this Exploit, you learn another Exploit of your choice from those available to the Barbarian.
