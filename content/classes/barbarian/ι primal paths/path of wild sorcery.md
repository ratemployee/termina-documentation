> For some Barbarians, their Rage boils up from an unrealized magical potential. When those born with an arcane spark fail to channel it in the correct way, this uncontrollable power can burst forth in a chaotic storm of magic-infused battle fury.

### magic awareness
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF WILD SORCERY FEATURE`

As an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of spells or magic items within 60 feet that aren't behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn its school of magic. 

You can use this feature once per short or long rest at no cost, after which you must expend an Exploit Die to use it.
### wild sorcery
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF WILD SORCERY FEATURE`

When you Rage, you roll on the Wild Sorcery table on the following page to determine the magic effect you produce. 

If a Wild Sorcery effect requires a saving throw, targets make their saving throws against your Exploit save DC.

| **d20** | **Wild Sorcery Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **d20** | **Wild Sorcery Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|   01    | Creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. You then gain temporary hit points equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die + your level.                                                                |   11    | For the duration of your current Rage, you gain resistance to the last instance of damage you took, until you take another instance of damage. For example, if you take fire damage from a red dragon's fire breath, you are resistant to fire damage until you take another type of damage.                                                                        |
|   02    | You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.                                                                                                                                                          |   12    | For the duration of your current Rage, every hair on your body grows by one foot at the end of each of your turns. When your current Rage ends, all of your hair falls out.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   03    | An orb of wild magic explodes at a point that you can see within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to your Exploit Die. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use a bonus action to cause this effect to happen again.                                    |   13    | A bolt of radiant light shoots from your chest. A creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take radiant damage equal to your Exploit Die and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until the end of your current Rage, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |
|   04    | Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your current Rage, the weapon's damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the magic weapon leaves your hand, it appears in your hand at the end of your turn. |   14    | For the duration of your current Rage, you can walk through solid objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your movement inside a creature or object, you are instantly shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for each 5 feet that you were forced to travel.                                                |
|   05    | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before the end of your current Rage, it takes force damage equal to your Exploit Die, as magic lashes out in retribution.                                                                                                                                                         |   15    | Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum: 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   06    | Until the end of your current Rage, you are surrounded by multicolored, protective lights; you, and allied creatures within 10 feet of you, all gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.                                                                                                                                               |   16    | For the duration of your current Rage, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried, instantly bursts into flame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   07    | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you; until the end of your current Rage, the ground within 15 feet of you is considered difficult terrain for creatures of your choice.                                                                                                                                                  |   17    | Your limbs grow strangely long. For the duration of your current Rage, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   08    | Roll another d20. On an even roll, your size grows by one category as if by the enlarge part of the [[enlarge/reduce]] spell. On an odd roll, your size is reduced by one category as if by the reduce part of the [[enlarge/reduce]] spell.                                                                                       |   18    | Your muscles are engorged with wild magic. For the duration of your current Rage, all creatures have disadvantage on any saving throws to resist the effects of your Exploits.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   09    | You can't speak for the duration of your current Rage. If you try, a small bird flies out of your mouth and toward the sun.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   19    | For the duration of your current Rage, the distance of your long and high jumps is tripled, even if this extra distance would exceed your remaining movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   10    | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.                                                                                                                                                         |   20    | You instantly regain all expended uses of your Rage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
### sorcerous infusion
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF WILD SORCERY FEATURE`

As an action, you can touch a creature, including yourself, and confer one of the following benefits to that creature: 
- Choose an ability score. For 10 minutes, when the target makes an ability check or saving throw with that ability score it gains a bonus to its roll equal to your Exploit Die. 
- The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Exploit Die. For as long as the temporary hit points last, the target is immune to Wild Sorcery effects. 
- You touch a target and expend any number of Exploit Dice. The target regains an expended spell slot of a level equal to the number of Exploit Dice you expend. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses each time you finish a long rest.
