> Barbarians that follow this Primal Path make use of alchemy and dark transmutation magic to mutate their physical form. The savage fury of their Rage triggers massive physiological changes thanks to reagents in their blood. These mutants are often on a quest to evolve their bodies into the ultimate form.

#### mutagenic exploits
You learn certain Exploits at the Barbarian levels noted in the table below. These don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched upon gaining a level.

### aberrant alchemy
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF THE MUTANT FEATURE`

You develop a deep knowledge of the sinister side of alchemy. You gain proficiency in Nature and with alchemist's supplies.

This knowledge allows you to create mutagens which, when combined with your Rage, radically alter your body.

$\quad$ `Mutations Known.` You know three Mutations of your choice from the list at the end of this subclass description.

During a long rest, so long as you have access to your alchemist's supplies, you can spend 1 hour to replace one Mutation you know with another Mutation of your choice.

You learn two additional Mutations of your choice when you reach 6th level, 10th level, and a final two at 14th level.

$\quad$ `Manifest Mutations.` When you Rage, you manifest a number of Mutations equal to your Constitution modifier. These Mutations last until the end of your current Rage.
### enduring mutation
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE MUTANT FEATURE`

Your advances in the dark alchemy of mutation have evolved. At the end of each long rest, choose one Mutation you know. You gain the benefits of that Mutation, even when not Raging, until the end of your next long rest.

However, when you Rage, this Mutation counts against the total number of Mutations you can manifest for that Rage.
### noxious strike
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE MUTANT FEATURE`

You can weaponize the toxins in your blood. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, roll a d6, and the creature suffers the corresponding condition from the table below:

| **d6** | **Effect** |
| :----: | :--------: |
|   1    |  blinded   |
|   2    |  charmed   |
|   3    |  deafened  |
|   4    | frightened |
|   5    | paralyzed  |
|   6    |  poisoned  |
This effect lasts for 1 minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of this ability for the next 24 hours.
### rapid mutation
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF THE MUTANT FEATURE`

ou have gained mastery over your body's mutability. While Raging, you can use a bonus action to end one Mutation and replace it with another Mutation that you know.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## mutations
Listed below are the Mutations available to Barbarians of the Path of the Mutant. If a Mutation has prerequisites, like your Barbarian level, you can learn it at the same time you meet it.
#### aberrant sight

You sprout unnatural eye stalks or manifest additional eyes. You gain darkvision out to a 60-foot radius. If you already have darkvision its range increases by 60 feet. 

In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks you make that rely on your sense of sight.
#### alchemical resistance

Your experiments grant you resistance to the elements. When you manifest this Mutation, choose acid, cold, fire, poison, or lightning, and you gain resistance to that damage
#### aquatic adaptation

You sprout unnatural gills or your skin becomes permeable and amphibious. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe both air and water.
#### deviant glide

You grow bat or fish-like skin flaps that you use to glide. When you fall and are not incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from your fall when calculating fall damage, and you can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you fall.
#### enhanced movement

Your legs grow unnaturally thick or powerful. Your walking speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Constitution modifier (minimum: 5 feet), and you add your Constitution modifier (minimum: +1) to the distance of any long jump or high jump you make.
#### oozing form

Your body becomes slimy and pliable. As a bonus action, you can automatically escape a grapple or nonmagical restraints. Also, your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, can squeeze through spaces as narrow as 1 inch.
#### synthetic carapace

Your skin hardens resembling that of a terrible insectoid or reptilian creature. You gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to half your Constitution modifier (rounded down).
#### unnatural physicality

Your muscles and veins engorge with toxic chemicals that grant you unnatural power and maneuverability. You gain a bonus to any Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks you make equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
#### corrosive secretions
`PREREQUISITES: 6th-level Barbarian`

Your body can expel a corrosive acid at your enemies. When you are hit by an attack and the attacker is within 30 feet, you can use your reaction to deal acid damage to the attacker equal to on roll of your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier.
#### inoculated vigor
`PREREQUISITES: 6th-level Barbarian`

Your experiments have hardened your body against toxins. You gain resistance to both acid and poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws you make to resist the poisoned condition
#### toxic vigor
`PREREQUISITES: 6th-level Barbarian`

Your body mends itself as you fight. At the start of your turns while Raging, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1 temporary hit point).

`PREREQUISITES: 6th-level Barbarian`

Your hands and feet secrete a sticky substance. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces without making an ability check.
#### acidic bile
`PREREQUISITES: 10th-level Barbarian`

You can spew a corrosive substance forth from your mouth. You learn the [[acid splash]] cantrip, using Constitution as your spellcasting modifier. You can cast this cantrip while Raging, and when you do, it deals additional damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: +1).
#### grappling appendages
`PREREQUISITES: 10th-level Barbarian`

You grow two appendages alongside your arms that resemble tentacles. They are natural weapons, which deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Exploit Die on hit. If you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can attempt to grapple it with these appendages as a bonus action. These appendages are not dexterous enough to use weapons or specialized tools.
#### perverted flight
`PREREQUISITES: 14th-level Barbarian`

You sprout a pair of unnatural leathery or insectoid wings. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
