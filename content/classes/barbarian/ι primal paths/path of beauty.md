> Where most Barbarians are hulking warriors with menacing physiques, those who walk the Path of Beauty draw power from their delicate, yet strong, forms. Often, their Rage is an outward manifestation of their inner beauty that transforms them into warriors who are as deadly as they are beautiful.

### elegant warrior
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF BEAUTY FEATURE`

You focus on cultivating a beautiful form rather than turning yourself into a brutish weapon. When calculating your Armor Class you can use your Charisma modifier in place of your Dexterity or Constitution (but not both). 

You also gain proficiency in Performance, and when you make a Charisma (Performance) check you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Constitution modifier.
### tantalizing presence
`3RD-LEVEL PATH OF BEAUTY FEATURE`

Your Rage enhances your beauty, making you irresistible to those of weak will. While Raging, you can use a bonus action to force a creature that can see you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you for up to 1 minute. 

The charm effect ends early if your Rage ends, or if you, or your allies, harm the creature in any way. The creature can also repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save. 

You can use this feature once per Rage at no cost, after which you must expend an Exploit Die to use it again.
### dazzling visage
`6TH-LEVEL PATH OF BEAUTY FEATURE`

You can draw on your Rage to envelop you in terrible beauty. As an action, you can expend a use of your Rage and make a Charisma (Performance) check, instantly gaining temporary hit points equal to the result of your roll. 

While the temporary hit points from this feature remain, you have advantage on any Charisma checks you make.
### beautiful glance
`10TH-LEVEL PATH OF BEAUTY FEATURE`

The sheer elegance of your beauty distracts your foes. When a creature that can see you attacks you while Raging, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, it must choose a different target, or its attack automatically misses. On a successful save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

Any creature that is immune to the charmed condition automatically succeeds on its saving throw.
### otherworldly grace
`14TH-LEVEL PATH OF BEAUTY FEATURE`

Your presence carries a divine grace that can shock your foes into inaction. When a creature fails its saving throw against Beautiful Glance it is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, or until you or your allies attack it. 

Moreover, when you use Tantalizing Presence you can choose for the target to be stunned instead of charmed.
