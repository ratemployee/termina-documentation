<hr>

### expertise
Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.
### sneak attack
You learn to exploit the weak points of your enemies. Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon, you can deal a bonus 1d6 damage, so long as one of the conditions below are met:
- You have advantage on your attack roll.
- An enemy of your target (other than you) is within 5 feet of your target, and the other enemy isn't incapacitated.

You don't gain the benefits feature if you have disadvantage on your attack roll, even if the other conditions are met.

The bonus damage of Sneak Attack increases as you gain Rogue levels as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.
### thieves' cant
You learn to speak, understand, and leave messages in Thieves' Cant, the secret jargon of the criminal underworld. You can use this secret mix of doublespeak and code words to hide messages in normal conversation which can only be understood by those who know Thieves' Cant.

You can also use your knowledge of Thieves' Cant to write and understand secret signs and symbols that convey short, simple messages. For example, you may use these symbols to mark an area as the territory of your thieves' guild, or to mark an inn as a haven for outlaws or a place to sell illegal wares.
### cunning action
Your sharp reflexes allow you to move and adapt quicker than most. At 2nd level, choose two of the following actions: Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object. You can use one of these chosen action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

When you reach 6th level in this class, you can use any of the four actions listed above as a bonus action on each turn.
### devious exploits
At 2nd level, you learn to utilize various tricks that enhance your particular set of skills, both on and off the field of battle:
#### exploit dice
The Rogue table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform any Exploits you know. Most Exploits require you to expend these Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Exploit Dice begins as d4s and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Rogue table.
#### exploits known
You learn two [[devious exploits]]. The Exploits Known column of the Rogue table shows when you learn additional Exploits. To learn an Exploit, you must meet any prerequisites that it may have, like a minimum ability score or Rogue level.

Each time you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of the Devious Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice, so long as you meet that Exploit's prerequisites.
#### saving throws
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

$\quad$ **Exploit save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
### roguish archetype
At 3rd level, you choose one of the following Roguish Archetypes that best represents the skills and training of your rogue:

- [[arcane trickster]]
- [[assassin]]
- [[avenger]]
- [[bloodknife]]
- [[daredevil]]
- [[falconer]]
- [[gambler]]
- [[inquisitive]]
- [[mastermind]]
- [[phantom]]
- [[ruffian]]
- [[scout]]
- [[seeker]]
- [[skinchanger]]
- [[soulknife]]
- [[swashbuckler]]
- [[thief]]
- [[troubadour]]

The Roguish Archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 7th, 13th, and 17th level.
##### archetype exploits
Some Archetypes have a list of Archetype Exploits that you learn at the Rogue levels noted in the Archetype description. They don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched out for other Exploits. If you do not meet an Archetype Exploit's prerequisites, you learn it regardless.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### cunning strike
You can exploit even the smallest weaknesses to great effect. Beginning at 5th level, when you add your Sneak Attack bonus to a damage roll, you can forgo some of the bonus to use a Devious Exploit you know without expending an Exploit Die, with the following rules:
- It must be a Devious Exploit that you know that can be used as part of a weapon attack.
- You reduce your Sneak Attack bonus damage by a number of d6s equal to the degree of the Exploit.
- If the Exploit normally deals additional damage, it does not deal any additional damage when used in this way.

For example, if you were to use this feature to use [[devious exploits#dirty hit|dirty hit]] as part of a Sneak Attack, you would reduce your Sneak Attack bonus damage by 2d6 since [[devious exploits#dirty hit|dirty hit]] is a 2nd-degree Exploit, and [[devious exploits#dirty hit|dirty hit]] would not deal any additional damage to your target.
### uncanny dodge
Also starting at 5th level, your precisely honed reflexes allow you to quickly dodge, deflect, or otherwise absorb the damage of blows that would devastate others. When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use a reaction to halve the damage you would take.
### evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an [[ice storm]] spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
### ruthless
At 11th level, you can use Cunning Strike to reduce your Sneak Attack bonus damage by an additional number of d6s equal to the degree of the Exploit you are using and force your target to make its saving throw with disadvantage.

For example, if you used Cunning Strike to use [[devious exploits#dirty hit|dirty hit]], you would reduce your Sneak Attack bonus by an additional 2d6 to impose disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw.
### reliable talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
### blindsense
Your senses have been honed to supernatural levels. Starting at 14th level, if you can hear, you are aware of the location of any invisible or hidden creature within 10 feet of you.

At 20th level, the radius of this feature becomes 30 feet.
### slippery mind
You have acquired immense mental strength. Beginning at 15th level, you gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. In addition, whenever you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### elusive
It is nearly impossible for your foes to gain the upper hand. Beginning at 18th level, so long as you are not incapacitated, no attack rolls against you can be made with advantage.
### stroke of luck
You have a supernatural knack for finding success when you need it most. Upon reaching 20th level, when you roll a d20 for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can treat the result as a 20 on the d20. You can do so after you know the result of your roll and whether you succeed or fail.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
