With your Bird of Prey watching from the skies above, there is little that can escape the wrath of your talons and blade.

### bird of prey
`3rd-level falconer feature`

You complete the training of a Bird of Prey to adventure by your side. You determine its appearance, but this choice has no effect on its game statistics. Common Birds of Prey are hawks, falcons, eagles, and vultures. It is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It uses the Bird of Prey stat block on this page, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) and Exploit save DC in several places.

In combat, the Bird acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use your bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another combat action.

When you take the Attack action, you can command your Bird to take the Attack action in place of one of your attacks. If you are incapacitated, your Bird of Prey can act on its own.

If your Bird falls to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. Should your Bird of Prey die, you can spend time during a long rest to seek out a worthy bird from the wild to serve as your Companion, so long as such a bird exists. Once you bond with such a bird, it uses the Bird of Prey stat block.

### falconer's training
`3rd-level falconer feature`

You have dedicated many days to the art of falconry. You gain proficiency in both Animal Handling and Nature if you do not have it already. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Nature) or a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check related to flying birds, beasts, or monstrosities of any kind, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### avian bond
`7th-level falconer feature`

Your connection with your Bird of Prey has grown. You and your Bird of Prey can use whistles, chirps, and gestures to share simple ideas and convey information to each other.
### primal hunter
`7th-level falconer feature`

Through dedicated training, you have honed the natural skills of your Bird of Prey. Whenever an effect allows your Bird of Prey to make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, it takes no damage on a success, and half damage on a failure.

Also, when your Bird of Prey hits a creature with a Talon attack that would meet the requirements for Sneak Attack, it can forgo the damage of its attack to force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, it is blinded until the start of your next turn.
### harrying strikes
`13th-level falconer feature`

When a creature within 10 feet of your Bird of Prey makes an attack, your Bird can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on their attack roll.
### falconer of legend
`17th-level falconer feature`

Your Bird of Prey rivals the great winged beasts of legends. Once per turn when your Bird of Prey hits with a Talon attack that meets the requirements for Sneak Attack, it can add your Sneak Attack bonus to its damage roll. Your bird of Prey rolls d4s in place of the normal d6s for Sneak Attack.
