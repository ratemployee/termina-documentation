> Rare amongst those who practice the roguish arts is one who has true psionic potential. When trained to unlock the psionic power within themselves, these rogues can train to become Soulknives. Using their wondrous abilities, they can manifest blades of pure mental power, communicate telepathically, and augment their considerable skills with psionic enchantment.

### psionic awakening
`3rd-level soulknife feature`

You have unlocked the wondrous potential of your mind and gained psionic abilities. Your psionic power is represented by a pool of Psi Points. You have a number of Psi Points equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 2), and you regain all expended Psi Points when you finish a short or long rest. You also unlock the following wondrous psionic abilities:

$\quad$ `mystical skill.` When you fail an ability check, you can expend 1 Psi Point to add one roll of your Exploit Die to your roll, possibly turning failure into a success.

$\quad$ `telepathic link.` As an action, you can expend 1 Psi Point to form a telepathic link with a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1) that you can see for 1 hour. Creatures don't need to share a language, but they must be able to speak one language to communicate telepathically. At the end of the hour, you can spend 1 Psi Point to extend the duration of your telepathic link by 1 hour.
### psionic blade
`3rd-level soulknife feature`

You can manifest Psionic Blades of pure mental energy in a free hand (no action required). Your Psionic Blades use the statistics of a dagger, but they deal psychic damage in place of piercing. You can cause your Psionic Blades to vanish at will, and when thrown, they vanish after they hit or miss. Then they deal damage, Psionic Blades leave no marks.

As you gain Rogue levels, the damage die of your Psionic Blades increases to match the size of your Exploit Die.
### metaphysical shift
`7th-level soulknife feature`

You can shift your place in reality with the mystic power of your mind. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend Psi Points to teleport 20 feet per Psi Point you expended to an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
### soul strike
`7th-level soulknife feature`

Your mind guides your blades. Whenever you make an attack with a Psionic Blade and miss, you can expend 1 Psi Point to add one roll of your Exploit Die to your attack roll.

Moreover, when you hit a creature with a Psionic Blade attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can use your [[rogue class overview#cunning strike|cunning strike]] feature to reduce the bonus by 3d6 and force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn, and can only do one of the following on its next turn: move up to its full speed, use one action, or use one bonus action.
### shimmer
`13th-level soulknife feature`

You can erase your presence from the minds of others. As an action, you can veil yourself with psionic energy as if you had cast the [[invisibility]] spell on yourself. However, unlike the spell, this feature does not require your concentration.

Once you use this feature to turn invisible, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend 1 Psi Point to use this feature again.
### mental scourge
`17th-level soulknife feature`

You can focus the power of your Psionic Blade to strike directly at your foe's mind. When you use Soul Strike to force a creature to make an Intelligence saving throw, you can reduce your Sneak Attack bonus by an additional 3d6 (for a total of 6d6) to empower the strike further. On a failed save, the creature is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.
