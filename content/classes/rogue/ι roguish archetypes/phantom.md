> You have formed a mystical connection with the border between life and death, and serve as a gateway to the afterlife. You have learned to draw upon this special connection to gain knowledge from the dead, and by immersing yourself in the mystical power of death, you gain strange abilities normally associated with spells.

### knowledge of the grave
`3rd-level phantom feature`

You gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice from beyond the grave, and when you finish a short or long rest, you can replace this proficiency with another of your choice.
### grave bolt
`3rd-level phantom feature`

You channel the pain and death of others into sinister magic. When you hit a creature with an attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can force another creature that you can see within 30 feet of your target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, roll half the number of dice you would roll for your Sneak Attack bonus (rounded up), and it takes necrotic damage equal to the roll.
### soul trinkets
`7th-level phantom feature`

You have gained the ability to siphon the energy of a departed soul. When a creature with an Intelligence of 5 or higher dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to capture a fraction of its power in a free hand, forming a Soul Trinket.

The DM determines the appearance of the Trinket, but it almost always reflects the true nature and values of the soul.

You can have a maximum number of Soul Trinkets equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1), and you can't create a new Trinket while at your maximum number of Trinkets.

Having a Soul Trinket grants you the following benefits:
- While one is on your person, you have advantage on both death saving throws and Constitution saving throws.
- When you hit with an attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can destroy a Soul Trinket to cause that attack to deal necrotic damage in place of its normal damage.
- When a creature fails its saving throw against Grave Bolt, you can destroy a Soul Trinket and cause the creature to be frightened of you until the beginning of your next turn.
- As an action, you can destroy a Soul Trinket to ask the soul within one question as if you'd cast [[speak with dead]].
### ghastly walk
`13th-level phantom feature`

You can temporarily step into the realm of the dead. When you take the Dash action, you can become incorporeal until the end of your current turn. While incorporeal, you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and you gain a temporary flying speed of 15 feet.

If you end your turn inside a solid object or creature, you are instantly shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you were forced to travel.
### death knell
`17th-level phantom feature`

You have become so acquainted with death that you can draw upon its power with ease. When you use Grave Bolt, you can force all creatures of your choice within 30 feet to make the Wisdom saving throw, and on a failed save, they take necrotic damage equal to your Sneak Attack bonus.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can empower Grave Bolt in this way again.
