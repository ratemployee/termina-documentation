> Many rogues use their larcenous talents to plunder forgotten temples and dusty tombs, and sometimes they uncover elder magic. Known as Seekers, these arcane explorers are known for collecting ancient secrets and fragments of eldritch power to augment their considerable skills with strange abilities.

### relic hunter
`3rd-level seeker feature`

You have spent many long nights learning about civilizations long forgotten by most mortals. You learn to speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice. Seekers often choose to learn archaic, ancient, or exotic languages.

You also gain proficiency in History, and if you spend at least 10 minutes touching and examining an object, you can ascertain its civilization of origin and its approximate age.
### relic magic
`3rd-level seeker feature`

You have cobbled together an eclectic assortment of magical objects and trinkets that grant you the following benefits:

$\quad$ `relics.` Relics are Tiny objects imbued with strange and ancient magics, and they often resemble the origin or type of magic within them. You have a number of Relics equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier. When your Intelligence modifier increases, you gain additional Relics of your choice. These may be Relics that you already had in your possession, but had yet to unlock the arcane secrets they contained.

$\quad$ `relic spells.` Each of your Relics is imbued with a single Relic Spell that cannot be changed. A Relic Spell is a cantrip or ritual spell of 2nd-level or lower, from any spell list. While you have a Relic on your person, you can cast the cantrip or the ritual version of the spell imbued within it.

$\quad$ `saving throws.` Your ability to use the magic of Relics is based on your understanding of their ancient workings. If a Relic requires a spellcasting modifier, you use Intelligence:

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### elder relics
`7th-level seeker feature`

In your strange travels and adventures you have unearthed, bartered for, or cobbled together Elder Relics which contain esoteric, eldritch and even divine powers. You gain an Elder Relic, which contains one of the following spells or abilities:

$\quad$ `channel divinity.` This Elder Relic contains the rites and prayers for a Channel Divinity from a Cleric [[cleric class overview#divine domain|divine domain]] of your choice. If the Channel Divinity requires a Cleric level or spellcasting modifier, you use your Rogue level and Relic spellcasting modifier. Once you use the Channel Divinity, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

$\quad$ `eldritch invocation.` This Elder Relic contains sinister or forgotten eldritch power. You learn one Eldritch Invocation of your choice from those available to the [[warlock class overview|Warlock]] class. If the Invocation has a prerequisite Warlock level, you can learn it if your Rogue level meets that level prerequisite.

$\quad$ `greater ritual.` This Elder Relic contains one ritual spell of your choice of 5th-level or lower from any class' spell list. Like the other Relic Spells, you can cast this spell as a ritual as long as you have this Elder Relic on your person.
### expert archaeologist
`7th-level seeker feature`

Your time in deadly tombs and dungeons has given you an uncanny ability to avoid traps and the other dangers within. You gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on any saving throw you are forced to make against traps of any kind.
- You can use [[modify device|modify device]] at will, without expending an Exploit Die, so long as you have the correct tools.
- You have advantage on thieves' tools or tinker's tools checks you make to investigate or disarm a trap.
### greater lore
`13th-level seeker feature`

You have added many esoteric and forgotten secrets to your collection. You gain three additional Elder Relics of your choice. You can choose to gain two Relics in place of one or more of the Elder Relics you would gain.

When you cast a Relic cantrip, you add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll, so long as you do not already add your spellcasting modifier to the damage roll.
### ancient lore
`17th-level seeker feature`

You understand the magic of the ancient world in a way that few living mortals do. You have advantage on saving throws you make to resist the effects of spells.

Finally, over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can perform a special ritual on one of your Relics or Elder Relics, changing its effect out for another possible Relic or Elder Relic effect of your choice.
