> The ancient magics of Druidic Circles are jealously guarded secrets, only taught to those deemed worthy. Skinchangers are rogues that have been granted (or have stolen) a portion of this ancient magic, and use this primal power to enhance their other skills. Often found in the service of powerful Fey or Archdruids, Skinchangers take on the shapes of animals to infiltrate places that no other rogue could possibly go.

### druidic secrets
`3rd-level skinchanger feature`

You learn to speak, read, and write Druidic, the language of druids. You can use this language to leave hidden messages. Those who know Druidic always notice such messages, but others must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Exploit save DC to decipher it without magic.

You also count as a rogue and a druid for the purposes of attuning to magic items and using spell scrolls.
### limited wild shape
`3rd-level skinchanger feature`

The druidic magic you have acquired allows you to steal the forms of beasts. You start with knowledge of three different Beast Forms of CR 1/4 or lower that do not have a flying or swimming speed. You learn additional Beast Forms by touching a living Beast within the restrictions for your rogue level  on the Skinchanger Beast Forms table.

At certain Rogue levels, you are able to learn Beast Forms of a higher CR or Forms with swimming or flying speeds, as indicated in the Skinchanger Beast Forms table.

As a bonus action, you can magically transform into the shape of one Beast Form you know, following all the rules of [[druid class overview#wild shape|wild shape]].

You can stay in Beast Form for up to one hour, at which point you revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier if you use a bonus action to do so, if you fall unconscious, if you drop to 0 hit points, or if you die.

Once you use your Wild Shape feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can Wild Shape again.

Finally, you can add your Sneak Attack bonus to natural weapon attacks while you are in Beast Form. However, all other rules of your Sneak Attack feature still apply.

| :--------------: | :--------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------: |
|       3rd        |    1/4     | No flying or swimming speed |      Panther       |
|       7th        |    1/2     |       No flying speed       |     Reef Shark     |
|       11th       |     1      |              —              |    Giant Eagle     |
|       17th       |     2      |              —              |     Cave Bear      |
### instinctual strikes
`7th-level skinchanger feature`

Druidic magic suffuses your Wild Shapes. While you are in Beast Form, your attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

In addition, you can use Wild Shape to transform into one of your Beast Forms twice between each short or long rest.
### bestial physique
`13th-level skinchanger feature`

Your time spent in Beast Shapes has enhanced the abilities of your normal form. When you make an ability check based on your sense of sight, hearing, or smell, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

Also, your unarmed strikes gain the finesse property and deal slashing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### druidic mastery
`17th-level skinchanger feature`

You have mastered the primal magic of the druids. You can remain in your Beast Form transformations indefinitely. Also, when you have no uses of your Wild Shape remaining, you can expend one Exploit Die to use Wild Shape again.
