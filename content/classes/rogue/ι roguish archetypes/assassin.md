### assassinate
`3rd-level assassin feature`

As an assassin, you are at your deadliest when your foes don't see you coming. You gain the following benefits:
- When you roll for initiative, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your initiative roll.
- You have advantage on weapon attack rolls against any creature that has not yet acted in combat.
- Whenever you hit a creature that is incapacitated or surprised with a weapon attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, it is an automatic critical hit.
### infiltrator
`3rd-level assassin feature`

You are adept at blending into places you don't belong. You gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

Over the course of 10 minutes, you can use your disguise kit to craft a disguise that resembles a dead or unconscious humanoid as long as you have its body. A suspicious creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Exploit save DC to attempt to see through your disguise.

Finally, you can unerringly mimic any humanoid's speech, so long as you spend at least 10 minutes observing them.
### deadly blade
`7th-level assassin feature`

You are exceptionally skilled at taking lives when conditions are right. When you score a critical hit and roll a 1 on any of your damage dice for that attack, you can reroll those dice.

Moreover, when you hit a creature with an attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can use your Cunning Strike feature to reduce the bonus by 1d6 and force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, it is poisoned until the start of your next turn.
### impostor
`13th-level assassin feature`

The skill with which you adopt other creatures' identities in nearly supernatural. You learn to speak, read, and write three additional languages of your choice, and whenever you make a Charisma (Deception) check to maintain your disguise, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

In addition, creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to see through any disguise you make.
### master poisoner
`13th-level assassin feature`

Your skill with poisons exceeds that of all others who study the toxic arts. You can use any Devious Exploit you know that allows you to craft a poison (such as [[craft minor poison|craft minor poison]]), and apply that poison to a weapon, as a bonus action.

You also learn [[craft advanced poison|craft advanced poison]], but it does not count against your total number of Exploits Known.
### death strike
`17th-level assassin feature`

You have become a master of instant death. Whenever you add your Sneak Attack bonus to a weapon attack, you can choose for that attack to become an automatic critical hit.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
