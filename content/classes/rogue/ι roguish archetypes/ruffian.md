### enforcer
`3rd-level ruffian feature`

You use brute force not often employed by rogues in combat. Your unorthodox fighting style grants you the benefits below:
- You gain proficiency with improvised weapons.
- Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier.
- You can apply your Sneak Attack bonus to your attacks with improvised weapons, unarmed strikes and simple melee weapons. All other Sneak Attack rules still apply.
- You can use your Constitution, instead of Dexterity, to calculate your Armor Class in light and medium armor.
### shake down
`3rd-level ruffian feature`

Your work requires skills that you have become particularly reliable in employing. You gain proficiency in Intimidation, and whenever you make a Strength (Athletics), or a Strength (Intimidation) check, you can treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
### intimidating blow
`7th-level ruffian feature`

Your ruthless style of fighting inspires fear in your enemies. When you hit a creature with a melee attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can use [[rogue class overview#cunning strike|cunning strike]] to reduce the bonus by 2d6 and force the target of your attack or one creature that can see you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
### nerves of steel
`7th-level ruffian feature`

Fear is a weapon that only works against cowards and the weak-willed. You gain immunity to the frightened condition.

In addition, you have advantage on any weapon attacks you make against a creature that is currently frightened of you.
### criminal connections
`13th-level ruffian feature`

You have a knack for finding criminal connections in any city. You learn the [[clandestine source|clandestine source]] Exploit, but it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.
### dodge and counter
`13th-level ruffian feature`

You can use your enemies' momentum against them. When a creature that is one size larger than you or smaller misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, it suffers one of the following effects:
- It falls prone and its speed is 0 for the rest of that turn.
- If you have a free hand, you can automatically grapple it.
- You can make one unarmed strike against it.
### ruthless strike
`17th-level ruffian feature`

You strike at those who fear you with ruthless intent. When you add your Sneak Attack bonus to a melee weapon attack against a creature that is frightened of you, you can choose for your attack to become an automatic critical hit.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
