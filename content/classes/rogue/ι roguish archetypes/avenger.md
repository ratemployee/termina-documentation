> Most adventurers who serve the gods do so openly as priests, clerics, and paladins. However, some dark and ruthless gods bestow divine power upon Avengers. These zealous servants work tirelessly to impose the will of their god upon the world and resort to whatever means they deem necessary to fulfil their goal. Operating from the shadows, Avengers are driven by faith alone, and they answer to no mortal creature.

### anointed magic
`3rd-level avenger feature`

Because of your fervent devotion to your god, you have gained the ability to channel their Divine Favor to cast holy spells:
#### divine favor
The blessings of your god are represented by a pool of Divine Favor. The Anointed Magic table below shows how much Divine Favor you have to cast Avenger spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast a spell, you must expend Divine Favor equal to the spell's level, and you regain all your expended Divine Favor when you finish a short or long rest.
#### divine limit
Your Rogue level limits the amount of Divine Favor that you can channel at one time. This limit is reflected in the Divine Limit column of the Anointed Magic table.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[avenger spell list]].  The Spells Known column of the Anointed Magic table shows when you learn more Avenger spells of 1st-level or higher. Spells you learn must be of a level equal to, or lower than, the Divine Limit for your Rogue level.

Whenever you gain a level, you can choose one Avenger spell you know and replace it with another Avenger spell of your choice of a level equal to your Divine Limit or lower.
#### spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Avenger spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when you set a spell saving throw DC, or when you make a spell attack roll.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### channel divinity
`3rd-level avenger feature`

You draw on the power of your god to produce miraculous effects. You know one effect: Divine Awareness, and you gain more at certain Rogue levels. Once you Channel Divinity, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.
#### channel divinity: *divine awareness*
As a bonus action, you can grasp a holy symbol of your god and open your senses to the presence of both powerful good and sinister evil. For 1 minute, you know the exact location and creature type of any celestial fiend, or undead within 60 feet that is not shielded from divination magic.
### consecrated blade
`3rd-level avenger feature`

Your weapons are blessed by the heavens to smite enemies and blasphemers. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can touch a melee weapon that you are proficient with and perform a special ritual to Consecrate it to your god and their divine purpose.

This Consecrated weapon becomes a holy symbol of your god and can be used as a spellcasting focus for your Avenger spells. You can also add your Sneak Attack bonus to attacks with it even if it does not have the finesse property. However, all other rules for Sneak Attack still apply.

You can have only one Consecrated weapon at a time.
### avenging strike
`7th-level avenger feature`

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Divine Favor to infuse a Consecrated weapon you are holding with divine power. For the next minute, your attacks with that weapon deal radiant damage in place of its normal damage type.

Moreover, your attacks with a Consecrated weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 on the d20. The critical hit range for your Consecrated weapon increases by 1 again at certain Rogue levels: at 13th level (18-20) and at 17th level (17-20).
### channel divinity: *declare end*
`7th-level avenger feature`

As a bonus action, you can hold aloft a holy symbol of your god and declare the impending death of one creature you can see within 10 feet. For 1 minute, or until that creature is slain, you have advantage on all attack rolls against it.
### divine step
`13th-level avenger feature`

Nothing can stand between you and those you have marked for divine justice. As a bonus action, you can expend 2 Divine Favor to instantly teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of a hostile creature. When you appear, you can make one weapon attack against it with advantage.
### hand of the gods
`17th-level avenger feature`

You stand among the most loyal and trusted mortal servants of your god. If you roll initiative with no uses of your Channel Divinity remaining, you instantly regain one expended use.

Also, whenever you reduce a creature marked by Declare End to 0 hit points, you can either mark another creature within range, or regain expended Divine Favor equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1 Divine Favor).
