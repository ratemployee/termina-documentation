> Where most rogues rely solely on their exquisite set of skills, you have chosen to compliment yours with magic. Enhancing your skills and subterfuge with arcane spells, you are able to achieve wondrous feats of trickery. Most rogues who walk the path of the Arcane Trickster tend to become pranksters, burglars, infiltrators, pickpockets, and even adventurers.

### spellcasting
`3rd-level arcane trickster feature`

When you adopt the Arcane Trickster Archetype, you learn to enhance your skills and talents with minor arcane spells:
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn three cantrips: [[mage hand]] and two other cantrips of your choice from the [[arcane trickster spell list]]. You learn another cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
#### spell slots
The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all of your expended spell slots each time you finish a long rest.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You know three 1st-level Arcane Trickster spells. The Spells Known column of your Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher, of a level for which you have spell slots.

When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with a spell from the [[arcane trickster spell list]]. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcane Trickster spells. You use Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for an Arcane Trickster spell.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### mage hand adept
`3rd-level arcane trickster feature`
You have mastered your limited knowledge of the arcane. When you cast [[mage hand]], it gains the following benefits:
- You can choose for the spectral [[mage hand]] to be invisible.
- You can control your [[mage hand]] with a bonus action.
- It can stow or retrieve an object from a container worn or carried by another creature within range.
- It can use any set of tools that you are proficient with.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed if you make a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against your target's Wisdom (Perception) check.
### trickster's ambush
`7th-level arcane trickster feature`

You can use subterfuge to enhance the power of your spells. If you target a creature with an Arcane Trickster spell while you are hidden from it, that creature has disadvantage on its initial saving throw to resist the effects of that spell.
### arcane distraction
`13th-level arcane trickster feature`

You use your magic to create openings in your foes' defenses. When you end your [[mage hand]]'s movement within 5 feet of a creature, you can cause it to distract that creature until you use it for another purpose. While a creature is distracted by your [[mage hand]], you have advantage on any weapon or spell attack rolls you make against that creature.
### spell thief
`17th-level arcane trickster feature`

Rather than learn magic on your own, you can steal arcane power from others. When a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area, you can use your reaction to force it to make a saving throw against your spell save DC using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effects on you and cause one of the following effects:
- You instantly regain a combined level of expended spell slots equal to the level of the spell that you negated.
- You gain the knowledge of the spell, so long as it is of a level that you can cast. You can cast that spell using your spell slots until the end of your next long rest. As part of your next long rest, you can permanently replace one of your Spells Known with the stolen spell.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher to use this feature again.
