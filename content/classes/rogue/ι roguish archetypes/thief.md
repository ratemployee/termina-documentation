### use magic device
`13th-level thief feature`

You have learned enough about the inner workings of magic objects that you can improvise the use of any item even when it is not intended for you. You ignore all alignment, class, race, and level requirements for the use of magic items, spell scrolls, and potions.
### quick reflexes
`17th-level thief feature`

The time you've spent pilfering pockets and treasures has honed your reflexes to near-supernatural heights. You gain an additional bonus action that you can take on each of your turns, though, it can only be used to take one of the actions from your [[rogue class overview#cunning action|cunning action]].

If you do not use this additional bonus action, you instead gain one additional reaction that you can use before the start of your next turn. A single effect can only trigger one reaction.
