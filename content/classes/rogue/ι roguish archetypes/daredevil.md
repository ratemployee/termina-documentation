### flying strike
`3rd-level daredevil feature`

You use the momentum of your airborne body as a weapon. If you move at least 10 feet through the air and land within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, you can use your action to force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failure, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die and falls prone. On a success, it takes half as much damage and remains upright.

If you are hidden from this creature when you force it to make this saving throw, or if an enemy of your target (other than you) is within 5 feet of it and isn't unconscious, you add your Sneak Attack bonus damage to the damage roll.
### nimble
`3rd-level daredevil feature`

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you are able to climb difficult and sheer surfaces at half your normal speed without making an ability check.

In addition, you can use your Dexterity score, in place of your Strength, when calculating the distance of your long jump or high jump.
### death from above
`7th-level daredevil feature`

You can strike at your foes from unorthodox airborne positions. Whenever you make a weapon attack while you are at least 10 feet off the ground and airborne, you have advantage on your attack roll.

You also add your Dexterity modifier to the damage dealt by your Flying Strike.
### slow fall
`7th-level daredevil feature`

Your experience falling from great heights has made you an expert at landing without hurting yourself. You can use [[aerial maneuver|aerial maneuver]] at will, without expending an Exploit Die.

When you manage to land on something soft that breaks your fall, like a wagon full of hay or a deep body of water, you take no damage from the fall.
### defy death
`13th-level daredevil feature`

Your many close brushes with death have made you adept at escaping it. You add your proficiency bonus to death saving throws. When you make a death saving throw and roll above a 20, it has the same effect as if you had rolled a 20 on the d20.
### masterful aerialist
`17th-level daredevil feature`

You are unparalleled in your ability to maneuver your body. Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check or a Dexterity saving throw and the total result is lower than your Dexterity score, you can use your Dexterity score in place of your roll.
