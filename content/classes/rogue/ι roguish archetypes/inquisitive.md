> When there are secrets to be uncovered or a mystery to be solved, there are none more adept than the rogues known as Inquisitives. These experts hone their skills of observation and deduction to heights that rival the most potent of divination spells. For an Inquisitive, the only thing that stands between them and the truth is time.

### eye for detail
`3rd-level inquisitive feature`

Your perceptive abilities are a finely honed tool. When you make a Wisdom (Insight) or a Wisdom (Perception) check, you can use your Intelligence in place of Wisdom.

In addition, you can use your Cunning Action to take the Search action as a bonus action on your turn. Whenever you take the Search action, you gain information as if you spent 10 minutes searching.
### predictive fighting
`3rd-level inquisitive feature`

You are able to observe a creature's fighting style to better predict openings in its defenses. As a bonus action, you can observe a creature within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by its Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you do not need advantage on your attack rolls to add your Sneak Attack bonus to weapon attacks against it for the next minute. All other Sneak Attack rules still apply.

If you attempt to use this feature on another creature, this bonus immediately ends for any previous targets.
### insightful strike
`7th-level inquisitive feature`

Your predictive capabilities in combat have increased. When you hit a creature with an attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can use your [[rogue class overview#Cunning Strike|cunning strike]] feature to reduce the bonus by 2d6 to learn one of the following about the target: its highest ability score, its lowest ability score, Armor Class, one of its movement speeds, or one of its special senses.
### adept investigator
`13th-level inquisitive feature`

Your investigative process leaves no stone unturned. It only takes you 1 minute to use [[survey dungeon|survey dungeon]] and 10 minutes to use [[survey settlement|survey settlement]], and whenever you use these Exploits, you learn a number of additional pieces of information equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1).

Finally, you can use these Exploits without expending an Exploit Die a total number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.
### unerring sight
`13th-level inquisitive feature`

Your perceptive abilities rival those of supernatural creatures. You gain Truesight to a 10-foot radius, and when you observe anything within that radius you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.

The radius of your Truesight becomes 20 feet at 14th level, and increases again to 30 feet when you reach 20th level.
### exploit weakness
`17th-level inquisitive feature`

You perfectly exploit your foe's most vulnerable points. While Predictive Fighting applies to a creature, you roll d8s in place of d6s for your Sneak Attack bonus against that creature.
