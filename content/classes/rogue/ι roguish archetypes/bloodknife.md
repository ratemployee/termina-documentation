> The Infernal Legions have many soldiers, but none are more deadly than those known as Bloodknives. The elite warriors of Hell's armies—or those trained by them—Bloodknives enhance their significant skills with infernal blood magic. By sacrificing their own vitality, they gain access to sinister abilities beyond the skill of other mortal warriors. Experts at sowing chaos and death among their foes, Bloodknives are dispatched by their superiors only when an especially fowerful foe needs to be dealt with.

### dread strike
`3rd-level bloodknife feature`

You can sacrifice your own vitality to empower your attacks with infernal magic. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one of your own Hit Dice to empower your attack with the following benefits:
- You do not need advantage on your attack roll to qualify for Sneak Attack. All other Sneak Attack rules still apply.
- You can choose for the attack's damage to be necrotic.
- If the attack reduces a hostile target to 0 hit points, you regain the Hit Die you expended to use this feature, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Rogue level.
### forked tongue
`3rd-level bloodknife feature`

You learn to speak, read, and write either Abyssal or Infernal. Depending on your choice, you gain the benefits below:

$\quad$ `abyssal.` You gain proficiency in Intimidation. Whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check while speaking Abyssal, you treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

$\quad$ `infernal.` You gain proficiency in Persuasion. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince a creature to agree to a bargain, contract, or an agreement of any kind, you can treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
### hellish curse
`7th-level bloodknife feature`

You infuse your blade with sinister magic to strike at body and soul. When you hit a creature with a melee attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can use [[rogue class overview#cunning strike|cunning strike]] to reduce the bonus by 1d6 and force the target to make a Charisma saving throw against your Exploit save DC.

On a failed save, it cannot regain hit points for the next minute. The creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
### siphon vitality
`7th-level bloodknife feature`

You can draw life from the pain you inflict. When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack against a hostile creature or reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to regain one expended Hit Die.
### vile curse
`13th-level bloodknife feature`

You can empower your sinister magic with your own vitality. When you use Hellish Curse or [[rogue class overview#cunning strike|cunning strike]] as part of a Dread Strike attack, the target automatically fails its initial saving throw against the Hellish Curse or the Exploit you used.
### touch of death
`17th-level bloodknife feature`

You wield infernal magic comparable to the most powerful servants of the Lords of Hell. Each time a creature fails its Charisma saving throw against your Hellish Curse feature, it gains one level of exhaustion.
