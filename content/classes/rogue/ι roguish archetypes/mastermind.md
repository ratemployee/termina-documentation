> You have put your considerable skill to work in mastering the art of manipulation. With a whisper and suggestion, you have a way of getting others to do what you want, even if it may not be in their best interest. Whether directing political gambits or allies in combat, you move others like pieces in a game.

### master of machinations
`3rd-level mastermind feature`

You have gathered a set of skills to aid in your machinations. You learn to speak, read, and write two additional languages, and you gain proficiency with the disguise and forgery kits.

You wield allies as others wield a weapon. You can use the Help action as a bonus action. When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet, so long as the ally you are helping can see or hear you.
### manipulative intuition
`7th-level mastermind feature`

You are adept at reading the motivations of others. When you spend at least 1 minute talking with or observing a creature outside of combat, you learn one of the following facts:
- One of its ideals, bonds, flaws, motivations, or alignment.
- Its true attitude toward you, or another creature that you observe it interacting with for the same duration.

Once you use this feature on a creature, you cannot use it on that creature again until you finish a long rest. Creatures with Legendary Resistances are immune to this feature.
### potent insight
`7th-level mastermind feature`

When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, and their attack hits, you can use your reaction to add your Sneak Attack bonus to its damage roll. However, if you do so, you cannot use Sneak Attack on your next turn.
### devious tactics
`13th-level mastermind feature`

You have no qualms about leaving others in danger. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force a creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Exploit Save DC. On a failure, you switch places with the creature and it becomes the target of the attack. A creature can willingly fail this save.
### inscrutable mind
`17th-level mastermind feature`

Your thoughts and dreams can't be read by magical means, unless you allow it. When a creature attempts to read your mind you can present false thoughts and motivations by making a Charisma (Deception) check. Finally, you gain immunity to both the charmed and frightened conditions.
