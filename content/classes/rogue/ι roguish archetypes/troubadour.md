### spellcasting
`3rd-level troubadour feature`

Your talent in poetry and music allows you to produce spells, much like the [[bard class overview|bard]] does. You gain the following benefits:
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn three cantrips: [[vicious mockery]] and two other cantrips of your choice from the [[bard spell list]]. You learn another Bard cantrip at 10th level in this class.
#### spell slots
The Troubadour Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the [[charm person]] spell and have both a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot, you can cast [[charm person]] using either spell slot.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[bard spell list]]. The Spells Known column of the Troubadour Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Bard spells of your choice of 1st-level or higher, of a level for which you have slots.

When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the [[bard spell list]]. The spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting focus
You can use any musical instrument you are proficient in as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
#### spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells, as your magic is fueled by poetry and song. You use Charisma when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a Bard spell.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
### romantic artistry
`3rd-level troubadour feature`

You have mastered many art forms in your pursuit of love. When you adopt this Archetype, you gain proficiency in Performance, and with two instruments of your choice.

When you make a Charisma (Performance) check, or a check with either musical instrument proficiency from this feature, you can treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
### poetic inspiration
`3rd-level troubadour feature`

You inspire others with poetic verse. When a creature that can hear you within 60 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to add one roll of your Exploit Die to its roll. You can use this reaction after the creature rolls, but before you know if it succeeds or fails.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once). You regain all uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses left, you can expend an Exploit Die to use this feature again.
### soothing performance
`7th-level troubadour feature`

Your poetry and song assuages the wounds and worries of your allies. When a creature spends one or more Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest with you, they regain additional hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### hopeless romantic
`13th-level troubadour feature`

Your poetic verse inspire the best in others through your undying love and affection. You regain all expended uses of Poetic Inspiration each time you finish a short or long rest.
### poetic assault
`17th-level troubadour feature`

Your verses cut to the emotional heart of your foes. When you damage a creature with a Bard spell of 1st-level or higher, you can add your Sneak Attack bonus to one target of the spell.
