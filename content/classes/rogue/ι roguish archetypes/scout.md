> [!quote|badge] 
> Unlike most rogues, your skills have been honed in the wild. You are adept at remaining unseen, scouting ahead of allies, stalking your prey, or hunting bounties. While you are most skilled in the wilderness, you can still hold your own in the back alleys of cities and deadly dungeons like most rogues.

### skirmisher
`3rd-level scout feature`

You are always on the move, never to be caught flat-footed by your foes. When a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
### survivalist
`3rd-level scout feature`

You have learned to survive, and thrive, in the wild places of the world. You gain proficiency in both Nature and Survival if you do not have it already, and whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) or an Intelligence (Nature) check, you add double your proficiency bonus to your roll.
### wilderness adept
`7th-level scout feature`

Your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain both a climbing and swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
### ambush master
`13th-level scout feature`

You can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls, and when you roll for initiative, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your initiative roll.

Also, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat is marked for death. Attack rolls against this target have advantage until the beginning of your next turn.
### sudden strike
`17th-level scout feature`

You strike with quiet, deadly speed. When you take the Attack action on your turn you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. You can add Sneak Attack bonus to this attack even if you have already used Sneak Attack, but you can't use Sneak Attack against the same target more than once a turn.
