> You have focused your training on the art of the blade. Where most rogues strike from the shadows, you prefer to face your enemies head-on, relying on your deadly skills and signature charm. When put into action, your swordsmanship resembles an elegant performance that relies on both speed and grace.

### fancy footwork
`3rd-level swashbuckler feature`

You dance about the field of battle, vexing your foes. If you make a melee attack against a creature, it cannot target you with opportunity attacks for the rest of your current turn.
### relentless swagger
`3rd-level swashbuckler feature`

You fight with unyielding confidence in yourself and your skill with a blade. When you roll initiative and are not surprised, you add your Charisma modifier to the result of your roll.

You also don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack bonus against a creature so long as you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on your attack roll. All the other rules for using Sneak Attack still apply to you.
### panache
`7th-level swashbuckler feature`

You have learned to knock your foes off-balance with nothing but wit and cunning words. When you hit a creature with an attack that adds your Sneak Attack bonus, you can use your [[rogue class overview#Cunning Strike|cunning strike]] feature to reduce the bonus by 1d6 to cause one of the following effects until the start of your next turn:

$\quad$ `charm.` One creature within 30 feet that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC or be charmed by you until the start of your next turn.

$\quad$ `taunt.` The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Exploit save DC or, until the beginning of your next turn, it has disadvantage on attacks against targets other than you and it cannot make opportunity attacks.
### elegant warrior
`13th-level swashbuckler feature`

You move about the battlefield with an unmistakable grace. When you take the Dash action on your turn, including when you use it as part of your Cunning Action, opportunity attacks targeting you are made with disadvantage.

In addition, whenever you make a Strength (Athletics), or Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Charisma (Performance) check you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
### master duelist
`17th-level swashbuckler feature`

Confidence in your skill with a blade lets you turn failure in combat into success. When you miss with an attack roll, you can choose to add your Charisma modifier (minimum: +1) to your attack roll, possibly turning a miss into a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses each time you finish a short or long rest.
