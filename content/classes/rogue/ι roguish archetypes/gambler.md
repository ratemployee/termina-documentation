> While all rogues excel at risky behavior, the life of a Gambler revolves around ever-increasing risk. Gamblers enjoy nothing more than high-stakes situations where they'll put everything on the line. Usually found in dark taverns and gambling dens, these Rogues can't help but gamble any gold or treasure they gain adventuring at a possible chance for more wealth.

### pick a card
`3rd-level gambler feature`

Decks of cards count as improvised weapons for you. When you use them as a weapon, playing cards have the finesse and thrown (30/60) properties, and on hit, your playing cards deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Dexterity modiifer.

Once per turn, when you hit a playing card attack the number rolled on the d4 grants your attacks a  bonus effect:

| **Roll** | **Bonus Effect**                                                                                                                                |
| :------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    1     | The target's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to five times your Dexterity modifier until the start of your next turn.                |
|    2     | You add your Sneak Attack bonus to this attack even if it doesn't meet the normal requirements.                                                 |
|    3     | You gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.                                                                            |
|    4     | You can choose to switch places in initiative order within the target, starting at the top of the initiative order in the next round of combat. |
### gambler's knack
`3rd-level gambler feature`

In life's games, sometimes you win, and sometimes you need to improvised. You gain proficiency with improvised weapons, playing cards, and one gaming set of your choice. Whenever you make an ability check that incorporates a gaming set, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.

Finally, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or playing a game you aren't familiar with, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability check related to the game. However, only one game or gaming set can benefit from this feature. Using it to learn a new game causes you to lose previous benefits.
### strange luck
`7th-level gambler feature`

You are blessed with an entertaining, yet strange, luck. Your weapon attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 7 or 20 on the d20, but your weapon attack rolls of 13 or 1 on the d20 are both considered critical failures.
### quickdraw
`13th-level gambler feature`

You always make the first move. You have advantage on initiative rolls, and if you make a playing card attack during your first turn, you can choose the effect of Pick a Card.

You also learn the [[pick a card|pick a card]] Exploit, but it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known. When you use this Exploit it also works for your thrown weapon attacks.
### jackpot
`17th-level gambler feature`

Your good fortune is another's bad luck. Whenever you roll a 6 on a d6 for one of your Sneak Attack bonus dice, you can roll one additional d6 and add the result to your damage roll.

In addition, the damage dealt by your playing card attacks increases to 2d4, and you choose which d4 result you use to determine the effect of Pick a Card for that attack.
