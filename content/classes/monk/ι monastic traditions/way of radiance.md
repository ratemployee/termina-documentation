### radiant bolt
`3rd-level way of radiance feature`

You have trained to focus your Ki into bolts of searing light. Whenever you would be able to make an unarmed strike, you can replace the unarmed strike attack with a Radiant Bolt.

Radiant Bolts are ranged (30/90) Martial Arts attacks that you are proficient in. On a hit, they deal radiant damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Dexterity modifier.
### searing blast
`6th-level way of radiance feature`

You can channel searing blasts of radiant Ki. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Ki Point to force all creatures in an adjacent 15-foot cone to make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take radiant damage equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, and half as much radiant damage on a successful save.

Beginning at 11th level, you can use your Ki Adept feature to use Searing Blast without expending Ki.
### radiant burst
`10th-level way of radiance feature`

Your spirit brims with a luminous radiance that you can channel to purify the world. As an action, you can unleash a wondrous blast of radiant Ki in a 5-foot wide, 100-foot long line, forcing all creatures within that area to make a Dexterity saving throw. They take radiant damage equal to six rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, and half as much radiant damage on a successful save.

You can expend Ki Points (up to your Wisdom modifier) to empower your Luminous Burst, adding one roll of your Martial Arts die to the damage for each Ki Point spent.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can spend 3 Ki Points to use Luminous Burst again.
### master of light
`17th-level way of radiance feature`

Your radiant spirit is a shining beacon of hope for all who stand against evil. You gain the benefits below:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed.
- You become wreathed in light. You shed bright sunlight in a 30-foot radius and dim sunlight 30 feet beyond that. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.
- The radiant damage of your Radiant Bolt, Searing Blast, and Luminous Burst features all count as true sunlight.
- You gain resistance to necrotic damage, immunity to radiant damage, and immunity to the blinded condition.
