### draconic disciple
`3rd-level way of the rising dragon feature`

Your martial arts are based on a specific type of dragon. Choose the scale color of your dragon from the options below, which grants you an affinity for a certain Element. Whenever you hit with an unarmed strike, you can deal that Element damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

| **Color** | **Element** |
| :-------: | :---------: |
| Amethyst  |    Force    |
|   Black   |    Acid     |
|   Blue    |  Lightning  |
|   Brass   |    Fire     |
|  Bronze   |  Lightning  |
|  Copper   |    Acid     |
|  Crystal  |   Radiant   |
|  Emerald  |   Psychic   |
|   Gold    |    Fire     |
|   Green   |   Poison    |
|    Red    |    Fire     |
| Sapphire  |   Thunder   |
|   Steel   |    Acid     |
|  Silver   |    Cold     |
|   Topaz   |  Necrotic   |
|   White   |    Cold     |
In your training, you have also learned to speak, read, and write Draconic, the language of the great dragons.

Finally, choose either Intimidation (usually chromatic dragons) or Persuasion (usually metallic dragons). You gain proficiency in that skill, and whenever you make a Charisma check with that skill, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Wisdom modifier.
### elemental breath
`3rd-level way of the rising dragon feature`

You can channel your Ki into destructive elemental breath reminiscent of mighty dragons. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 Ki to replace one attack with an exhalation of elemental breath, choosing to breathe in an adjacent 20-foot cone or a 30-foot long, 5-foot wide line.

Creatures within the area of your exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take damage of your Element equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, and half as much Element damage on a successful save.

Moreover, you can spend additional Ki Points (up to your Wisdom modifier) to increase the damage of your Breath by one roll of your Martial Arts die per Ki Point spent.

Starting at 11th level, you can use Ki Adept to use this feature at its base level without expending any Ki Points.
### ascendant step
`6th-level way of the rising dragon feature`

You can use your Ki and mystical Techniques to mimic the various abilities of dragons. Whenever you use [[monastic techniques#step of the wind|step of the wind]], you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed which lasts until the end of your current turn.
### draconic mantle
`10th-level way of the rising dragon feature`

Your training has begun to transform you into a true draconic being. You and creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you gain resistance to your Element damage and have advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed or frightened.

In addition, when you use your Elemental Breath, you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum: +1) to the damage roll.
### master of draconic might
`17th-level way of the rising dragon feature`

Your mystical power and combat prowess rivals that of a trueborn adult dragon. You gain the following benefits:
- You manifest leathery draconic wings which grant you a permanent flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- When you use your Elemental Breath, you can choose for it to be a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot long, 5-foot wide line.
- The range of your Draconic Mantle becomes 30 feet.
