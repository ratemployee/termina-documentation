> While all monks are warriors, the disciples of the Open Hand train relentlessly, honing their body itself into a weapon. They don't neglect their spiritual training but pride themselves on their skill with martial arts, and it is exceedingly rare to see an Open Hand monk using a weapon other than their fists.

#### open hand techniques
You learn certain Techniques at the Monk levels noted in the table below. These don't count against your number of Techniques Known.

### practiced strikes
`3rd-level way of the open hand feature`

Your discipline has made strikes second nature to you. Once per turn when you hit with an unarmed strike, you can use a *strike* Technique you know without spending a Ki Point.

You can use your *strike* Techniques in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses each time you finish a long rest.
### ebb and flow
`6th-level way of the open hand feature`

You have trained to redirect your enemy's momentum against them. When a creature you can see misses you with a melee attack, you can use one of the following reactions:
- You force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked prone and has its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its turn. Any creature that is at least one size larger than you has advantage on its saving throw.
- You can make one unarmed strike against the creature.
### open hand strike
`10th-level way of the open hand feature`

Your fists strike with such force as to disrupt the flow of your foe's Ki. When you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw that you force it to make a part of that unarmed strike attack.
### master of many forms
`17th-level way of the open hand feature`

You are able to master new Techniques with ease. During the course of a long rest, you can spend 10 minutes practicing your martial arts forms and replace a Technique you currently know with another Technique of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites.
