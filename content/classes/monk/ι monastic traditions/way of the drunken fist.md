> Where most monks are stereotyped as being serious and contemplative, students of the Drunken Fist seek out joy wherever they go. Masters of a style that mimics the unpredictable movements of a drunk, these monks will use their considerable skills to play the fool and make others laugh, or to embarrass haughty nobles.

### drunken style
`3rd-level way of the drunken fist feature`

You move about the battle with chaotic grace. On your turn, when you hit a unique creature with a Martial Arts attack, your speed increases by 5 feet until the end of that turn.

Also, when you hit a creature with a Martial Arts attack, that creature has disadvantage on any opportunity attacks it makes against you until the beginning of your next turn.
### jovial performer
`3rd-level way of the drunken fist feature`

You use your unique style of martial arts to bring joy with your antics. You gain proficiency in Performance, brewer's supplies, and with improvised weapons. Also, your attacks with improvised weapons count as Martial Arts attacks.
### unpredictable sway
`6th-level way of the drunken fist feature`

Your erratic movements have become more complicated and even harder to predict. You gain the benefits listed below:
- When you are prone, you can stand up without expending movement, rather than expending half your movement.
- When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to spend 1 Ki Point and force it to attack a creature of your choice within 5 feet of you, that is also within range of its attack.
### chaotic luck
`10th-level way of the drunken fist feature`

You have an almost comical way of turning the misfortunes that befall you on their head. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or saving throw with disadvantage, you can spend 1 Ki Point to cancel the disadvantage on that roll.
### master of the drunken fist
`17th-level way of the drunken fist feature`

You fly about the battle with an unparalleled level of chaos. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make a single Martial Arts attack against each creature you move past that is within range of your unarmed strikes, even if the number of attacks you make would exceed the normal limit.
