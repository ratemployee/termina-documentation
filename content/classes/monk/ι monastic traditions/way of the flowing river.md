### flowing river stance
`3rd-level way of the flowing river feature`

You have trained to utilize the signature stance of your order. You can use an action on your turn to enter a Flowing River Stance, which lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

While you're in this stance, you have a second reaction you can use each round. You gain additional reactions at certain Monk levels: at 6th level (3), 10th level (4), and 17th level (5).

When a creature that you can see misses you with a melee attack while you are in your Flowing River Stance, you can use a reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked prone and its movement speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn.
### monastic dancer

Your training allows you to move with a delicate grace not often found in warriors. You gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Performance, and whenever you make an ability check with either of these skills, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die.

Monks of your Tradition are also known for their dancing. When you would make a Charisma (Performance) check, you can make a Dexterity (Performance) check instead.
### enchanting flow

When you enter your Flowing River Stance, you can spend 1 Ki Point to mystically allure your foes. Until the start of your next turn, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on all targets other than you.

Beginning at 11th level, you can use your Ki Adept feature to use Enchanting Flow without expending a Ki Point.
### graceful step
`10th-level way of the flowing river feature`

You move with a supernatural level of grace and poise. When you enter your Flowing River Stance, you gain the benefits of [[monastic techniques#patient defense|patient defense]] without spending a Ki Point.
### master of the flowing river
`17th-level way of the flowing river feature`

When a creature fails its saving throw against your Flowing River Stance reaction, you can knock it back in a straight line in addition to the reaction's normal effects. When you do so, it is knocked back a number of feet depending on its size:

|  **Size**  | **Distance** |
| :--------: | :----------: |
