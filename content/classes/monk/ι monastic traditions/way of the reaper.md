> While most monastic orders teach their students to live their lives to their full potential, those who practice the Way of the Reaper are obsessed with the ending of lives. Reaper monks learn to channel deathly Ki to fuel their own martial prowess and are experts at using fear and other sinister techniques to drain the life force from others in order to prolong their own.

### frightful touch
`3rd-level way of the reaper feature`

You can channel your Ki into other creatures to infect them with fear. When you hit a creature with a Martial Arts attack, you can spend 1 Ki Point to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

Beginning at 11th level, you can use your Ki Adept feature to use Frightful Touch without expending any Ki Points.
### necrotic spirit
`3rd-level way of the reaper feature`

Your affinity with deathly Ki has completely suffused your body, mind, and spirit, granting you the benefits below:
- You can cause your unarmed strikes to deal necrotic damage in place of the normal bludgeoning damage.
- You are resistance to necrotic damage.
- When you are forced to make a saving throw to resist being frightened, you have advantage on your roll.
### sinister vitality
`6th-level way of the reaper feature`

You can infuse your physical form with necrotic vitality. As a bonus action on your turn, you can grant yourself temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1).

While these temporary hit points last, you are resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
### armor of the grave
`10th-level way of the reaper feature`

You are so familiar with death that you resist its grasp. If you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can spend 1 Ki Point to fall to 1 hit point instead.

Each subsequent time you use this feature before you finish a long rest, you must spend 1 additional Ki Point.
### master of death
`17th-level way of the reaper feature`

You can channel the sinister Ki of death through your touch. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can touch a creature in place of one of your attacks and spend up to 10 Ki Points, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 necrotic damage per Ki Point you spent on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

A creature that is frightened of you has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to resist this feature.
