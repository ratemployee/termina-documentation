### solid body
`3rd-level way of the boulder feature`

Your great bulk enhances your offense and defense. When not wearing armor or a shield, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

You can also use Constitution, in place of your Strength or your Dexterity, for Martial Arts attack and damage rolls.
### stalwart strength
`3rd-level way of the boulder feature`

You draw strength from the earth beneath you. When you make a Strength-based ability check or a Strength saving throw while you are touching the ground, you can spend 1 Ki Point to add your Constitution modifier to your roll.

When you reach 11th level in this class, you can use your Stalwart Strength without expending a Ki Point.
### rebounding defense
`6th-level way of the boulder feature`

When a creature you can see hits you with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 Ki Point as a reaction to attempt to absorb the blow with your bulk. Reduce the damage by an amount equal to your Monk Level + one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Constitution modifier.

If you reduce the damage of the attack to zero, you can rebound the blow back as part of the same reaction, making a melee Martial Arts attack against your attacker.
### ki-infused bulk
`10th-level way of the boulder feature`

Your dense, Ki-infused body allows you to resist physical and magical assaults. You gain resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You can replace this resistance with an option from the list above at the end of a short or long rest.

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 Ki Points to realign your Ki and replace the damage resistance from this feature with another option from the list above.
### earthshaker
`17th-level way of the boulder feature`

You can use your supernatural density to cause the earth to quake. As an action, you can expend 5 Ki Points to crush the ground, turning the ground within 30 feet of you into difficult terrain and forcing creatures of your choice within that range to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

When you use this feature, you can expend additional Ki Points (up to your Wisdom modifier) to increase the damage by one roll of your Martial Arts die for each Ki Point spent.
### mighty form
`17th-level way of the boulder feature`

Your body has surpassed the normal limits of mortal density and mass. Both your Constitution score, and your maximum Constitution score, increase by 2 to a maximum of 22.
