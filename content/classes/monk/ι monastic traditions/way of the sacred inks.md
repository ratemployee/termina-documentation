> Initiates of the Sacred Inks spend years practicing celestial calligraphy. Once they are ready, the monks ceremonially mark their bodies with increasingly complex celestial tattoos, granting them access to divine power. As the monk's spiritual connection to the divine grows, so does the beauty of their celestial tattoos.
