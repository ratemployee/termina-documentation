Assassins, spies, and infiltrators, Shadow Monks twist darkness to their advantage and will only strike when their success is absolutely assured.

### eyes of night
`3rd-level way of the shadow arts feature`

You gain darkvision out to a radius of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

In addition, you have advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make while you are in dim light or darkness.
### shadow arts
`3rd-level way of the shadow arts feature`

You can channel your Ki to cast the following spells: [[darkness]], [[darkvision]], [[pass without trace]], or [[silence]]. You can see through the magical darkness produced by your spells.

You can cast each spell once, and you regain the ability to cast them when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of a spell left, you can spend 2 Ki Points to cast it again.
### shadow step
`6th-level way of the shadow arts feature`

You move undetected through the darkness, and can step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. After teleporting, you have advantage on the first Martial Arts attack you make before the end of that turn.
### cloak of shadows
`10th-level way of the shadow arts feature`

You can cloak yourself with Ki and merge with the shadows. When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use an action to become invisible, and you remain invisible until you attack, cast a spell, or move into an area of bright light.

Also, when a creature moves into your reach while you are invisible, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack. Finally, opportunity attacks only end your invisibility if you hit the target. If the attack misses, you remain invisible.
### master of shadows
`17th-level way of the shadow arts feature`

You are an unrivaled master of the Shadow Arts, and have unlocked dark Ki powers which mark you as a true Master of Shadows. You gain the benefits listed below:
- You can cast your [[#shadow arts]] spells at will.
- The range of your [[#shadow step]] increases to 120 feet.
- You can use your [[#cloak of shadows]] as a bonus action.
- You can cast both [[greater invisibility]] or [[shadow of moil]] without expending a spell slot or material components. You can cast each spell once, and you regain the ability to cast them when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of a spell left, you can spend 4 Ki Points to cast it again.
