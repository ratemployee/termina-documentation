> Balance in all things. This is the mantra of monks that devote their lives to the Way of Yin and Yang. Known for their mystical abilities to manipulate Ki to heal wounds, cure disease, and even disrupt powerful curses, these monks keep all things in balance. However, when creatures look to extend their lives through unnatural means or cheat death, these warriors will use their powers to destroy said creatures, restoring balance.

### monastic healer
`3rd-level way of yin and yang feature`

In order to learn to heal with Ki, you first had to master the mundane medicinal arts. You gain proficiency with herbalism kits and in Insight and Medicine, and whenever you make an ability check with any of these proficiencies, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die.
### touch of life
`3rd-level way of yin and yang feature`

You have learned to manipulate the Ki of other creatures to heal wounds. Whenever you would make an unarmed strike, you can instead expend 1 Ki Point to touch a creature other than yourself, and restore a number of its hit points equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

Beginning at 11th level, you can use your Ki Adept feature to use Touch of Life without expending a Ki Point. However, when you do so, you grant the creature temporary hit points.
### touch of death
`3rd-level way of yin and yang feature`

You have learned to manipulate the Ki of other creatures to inflict pain. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 Ki point to deal additional necrotic damage to the target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die.

### mystical touch
`10th-level way of yin and yang feature`

Your ability to balance life and death grows with your spirit.
