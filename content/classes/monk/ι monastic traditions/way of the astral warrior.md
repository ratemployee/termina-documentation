### astral self
`3rd-level way of the astral warrior feature`

You manifest your Ki as a luminescent set of armor that resembles your true self. As a bonus action, you can expend 2 Ki Points to manifest your Astral Self.

When you do so, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

While your Astral Self is manifested, you gain the benefits listed below:
- You can use your Wisdom modifier, in place of Strength, whenever you make a Strength check or Strength saving throw.
- When you make an unarmed strike attack, you can use Wisdom in place of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls. Moreover, the reach of your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet, and they deal force damage.

This manifestation of your Astral Self lasts for 10 minutes. It is instantly dispelled if you die or become incapacitated, or you use your bonus action to dismiss it.
### astral visage
`6th-level way of the astral warrior feature`

You can draw on the presence of your Astral Self even when it is not manifested. You learn the [[thaumaturgy]] cantrip and Wisdom is your spellcasting modifier for it. Also, whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) or Charisma (Intimidation) check, you add one roll of your Martial Arts die to your roll.

When your Astral Self is manifested, you can see normally in both magical and mundane darkness in a 120-foot radius.
### mystical defense
`10th-level way of the astral warrior feature`

Your mystical connection with your Astral Self allows you to channel the elements. When you take acid, cold, fire, force, thunder, or lightning damage, you can use your [[monk class overview#deflect missiles|deflect missiles]] feature to reduce the damage, even if the effect wouldn't normally meet the triggering conditions of that feature. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can make a ranged Martial Arts attack as part of the same reaction, which deals the triggering damage type on a hit.

Also, once per turn when you hit with an unarmed strike while your Astral Self is manifested, you can deal additional force damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die.
### master astral warrior
`17th-level way of the astral warrior feature`

You have come to know who you truly are and are one with your Astral Self. While your Astral Self is manifested, you gain resistance to all damage except for force.

Moreover, while your Astral Self is manifested, you can use your action to unleash a barrage of punches in an adjacent 20-foot cone. Targets in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take force damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, and half as much on a success.
