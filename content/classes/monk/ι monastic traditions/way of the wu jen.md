> Rather than focus inward, some monks attune themselves to the forces of nature. Known as Wu Jens, these primal sages augment their skills with the power of the five elements: air, earth, fire, water, and wood. Through meditation, they can learn to channel their Ki into displays of elemental power.

### disciple of the elements
`3rd-level way of the wu jen feature`

You learn ancient monastic arts that allow you to cast spells.
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[wu jen spell list]]. You learn one additional Wu Jen cantrip at 10th and 17th level.
#### spell slots
The Wu Jen Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those slots. All of your spell slots are the same level. To cast a Wu Jen spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You use the spell's casting time and other rules, but your body becomes the spellcasting focus for these spells, and you don't need to provide any material components. You regain all expended Wu Jen spell sots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, at 7th-level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [[burning hands]], you must spend one of these Wu Jen spell slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.
#### ki casting
You can draw upon your Ki to regain your elemental powers. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a number of Ki Points equal to 1 + your Slot Level to regain one of your expended Wu Jen spell slots.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[wu jen spell list]]. The Spells Known column of the Wu Jen Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Wu Jen spells. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.

Whenever you gain a Monk level, you can choose one Wu Jen spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Wu Jen spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots, per the Wu Jen Spellcasting table.
#### spellcasting ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Wu Jen spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting a saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### fist of the five ways
`6th-level way of the wu jen feature`

You can infuse your fists with the power of the five elements. Whenever you make an unarmed strike, you can choose for it to deal bludgeoning, cold, fire, poison, or thunder damage.

In addition, when you empower an unarmed strike in this way, your reach with that unarmed strike increases by 5 feet.

Finally, when you use your action to cast a Wu Jen spell, you can make one unarmed strike attack as a bonus action.
### spiritual flow
`10th-level way of the wu jen feature`

You weave your martial arts with spiritual magic. When you cast a Wu Jen spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can expend 2 Ki Points to cast it as a bonus action instead.
### master of the elements
`17th-level way of the wu jen feature`

As an action, you can draw all five elements into yourself to take on an Elemental Form, gaining the following benefits:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You resist bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- Critical hits against you become normal hits.
- Opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.
- You can gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 1) at the start of each of your turns.

Your Elemental Form lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you are incapacitated or use a bonus action to end it. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. When you have no uses remaining, you can expend 6 Ki Points to take on your Elemental Form again.
