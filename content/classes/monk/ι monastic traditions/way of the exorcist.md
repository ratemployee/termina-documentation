### mystic arts
`3rd-level way of the exorcist feature`

You have been taught to channel your Ki in wondrous ways in order to combat evil spirits, known as Mystic Arts. You learn *Turn Undead* and one other Mystic Art of your choice from the list of Mystic Arts below.

You can use each of your Mystic Arts once at no cost, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses of a Mystic Art left, you can expend 3 Ki Points to use that Mystic Art one additional time.

Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Mystic Art you know (other than *Turn Undead*) with another Mystic Art of your choice. You learn one additional Mystic Art when you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class.
#### critical strike
When you hit a creature with a Martial Arts attack, you can read the proportions of its body to strike its weak point. This attack becomes a critical hit, regardless of your d20 roll.
#### dark flash
When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Technique save DC. On a failure, you take no damage from its attack, and it takes damage equal to your Monk level.
#### divergent strike
When you score a critical hit against a creature with a Martial Arts attack, you can use a bonus action on that same turn to force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your Technique save DC. On a failed save, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die.
#### mystical shift
As a bonus action, you can clap your hands together, instantly switching places with a creature you can see within 30 feet. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your Technique save DC.
#### residual reader
As an action, you open your senses to sinister energy around you. For the next 10 minutes, you can sense the presence of any fiend or undead creature within 30m feet of you.
#### spiritual transfiguration
As an action, you can cast [[alter self]] without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way, it does not require concentration.
#### turn undead
As an action, you speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Technique save DC. On a failed save, they are Turned, as if by the Cleric's [[cleric class overview#Channel Divinity]], for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
### spiritual defense
`6th-level way of the exorcist feature`

Your training has granted you an increased resilience against malevolent spirits. You gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and whenever a fiend or undead forces you to make a saving throw, you have advantage on your roll.
### exorcist's domain
`10th-level way of the exorcist feature`

You can manifest your will into reality, trapping friend and foe alike inside, if only briefly. As an action, you can cast a special version of [[hallucinatory terrain]], with the following changes:
- The spell effects the area in a 30-foot radius around you at the time of casting, instead of its normal area of effect.
- Creatures of your choice treat the area as difficult terrain.
- Creatures of your choice that attempt to leave the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Technique save DC in order to do so. On a failed save, a creature cannot attempt to leave until its next turn.

Your Domain lasts for 1 minute, unless you end it as an action, or you are incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
### master exorcist
`17th-level way of the exorcist feature`

You are a true master of the Mystic Arts. When you finish a short rest, you regain the use of one of your Mystic Arts.

Moreover, once per turn when you force a creature in your Exorcist's Domain to make a saving throw against a Mystic Art or Technique, you can impose disadvantage on its roll.

Finally, when you have no uses of your Exorcist's Domain left, you can expend 5 Ki Points to use it one additional time.
