> While monks of every Tradition strive for mastery over their physical form, honing their bodies into weapons, creatures born with natural weapons—vicious claws, imposing horns, sharp teeth, or lashing tails—have natural advantages in the quest to weaponize their bodies. Monks with these natural features often become disciples of the Way of Ferocity.

### natural predator
`3rd-level way of ferocity feature`

Your martial arts enhance your natural abilities with one of the disciplines below. Once chosen, this cannot be changed:
#### bestial rend
This discipline is most often adopted by monks with sharp claws and savage teeth. Your unarmed strikes deal slashing damage and inflict deep wounds. Each time you hit a target with an unarmed strike, its movement speed is reduced by a cumulative 5 feet until the beginning of your next turn. If this feature reduces a target's speed to zero, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.
#### natural defenses
This discipline is most often adopted by monks with armored hides, like scales or shells. When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to add one roll of your Martial Arts die to your Armor Class against the attack, possibly turning a hit into a miss.
#### savage charge
This discipline is most often adopted by monks with hooves or horns. If you move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a creature, you have advantage on the first Martial Arts attack against that creature before the end of your current turn.
### primal intuition
`6th-level way of ferocity feature`

You have honed your primal instincts with your martial prowess. Choose two skills from the following list: Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.

You gain proficiency in both skills, and whenever you make an ability check with either of these skills, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die.
### power of the wild
`10th-level way of ferocity feature`

You have trained to augment your physical strikes with the ferocity of your savage Ki. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 Ki Point as part of your attack to deal an additional 2d6 damage to the target.
### master of ferocity
`17th-level way of ferocity feature`

You combine your primal instincts with your monastic training to reach your true savage potential. You gain one of the disciplines below. Once chosen, it cannot be changed.
#### bestial fury
Like the greatest hunters of the wild, you can whip yourself into a primal fury when your prey is weak. When you score a critical hit against a creature with an unarmed strike, its movement speed is reduced to zero, and you have advantage on any unarmed strikes that you make against that creature until the beginning of your next turn.
#### natural resilience
You can draw on your wellspring of mystic power to harden your defenses and shrug off assaults. Whenever a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can expend Ki Points (up to your Wisdom modifier) to reduce the damage by one roll of your Martial Arts die for each Ki Point spent.
#### savage rush
You can channel a burst of primal speed to trample those in your path. As an action, you can spend 4 Ki Points and move up to your full walking speed in a straight line, and force any creature you pass through to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take bludgeoning damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.
