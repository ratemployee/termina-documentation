### martial arts
You have honed your body into a weapon, mastering many styles of martial arts. For the purposes of your Monk abilities, Martial Arts attacks are unarmed strikes, and any attacks with melee weapons that lack the heavy or special properties.

Starting at 1st level, so long as you are not wearing heavy armor, wielding a shield, or wielding a heavy weapon, your Martial Arts attacks gain the benefits listed below:
- You can use your Dexterity, in place of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls of your Martial Arts attacks.
- You can make a Dexterity (Athletics) check to grapple or shove in place of the normal Strength (Athletics) check.
- You can roll your Martial Arts die in place of the normal damage of a Martial Arts attack. This die starts out as a d6 and changes as you gain Monk levels, as indicated in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn and make a Martial Arts attack, you can use your bonus action on that same turn to make a single unarmed strike attack.
### unarmored defense
You have trained to defend yourself from deadly strikes even when unarmored. Beginning at 1st level, so long as you aren't wearing armor and not wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
### ki
At 2nd level, you learn to manipulate the spiritual energy that resides within you, known as Ki. You can draw on your Ki to perform supernatural physical feats known as Techniques.
#### ki points
Your inner reserve of Ki is represented by a pool of Ki Points. This pool has a total number of Ki points equal to your Monk level + your Wisdom modifier. You regain expended Ki Points when you finish a short or long rest, so long as you spent at least 30 minutes of that rest in spiritual meditation.
#### techniques known
At 2nd level, you learn three Techniques of your choice from the list of [[monastic techniques]]. You can only use one Technique per attack, ability check, or saving throw.

The Monk table shows when you learn more Techniques of your choice. When you gain a Monk level, you can replace one Technique you know with another Technique of your choice.
#### saving throws
Techniques rely on your mastery of body and spirit, and grow in proportion to your self-control. When a Technique requires a saving throw, its saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

$\quad$ **Technique save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
### flurry of blows
You can draw on your spiritual power to strike with blinding speed. Starting at 2nd level, when you take the Attack action and make a Martial Arts attack, you can spend 1 Ki Point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action on that turn.
### unarmored movement
Your pursuit of physical perfection has awakened the hidden potential of your body. At 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet so long as you are not wearing armor or a shield.

This speed bonus increases as you gain levels, as indicated in the Unarmored Movement column of the Monk table.
### monastic tradition
At 3rd level, you choose one of the following Monastic Traditions that best represents the training and philosophy of your Monk:

- [[way of the astral warrior]]
- [[way of the boulder]]
- [[way of the drunken fist]]
- [[way of the exorcist]]
- [[way of ferocity]]
- [[way of the flowing river]]
- [[way of the open hand]]
- [[way of radiance]]
- [[way of the reaper]]
- [[way of the rising dragon]]
- [[way of the sacred inks]]
- [[way of the shadow arts]]
- [[way of the wu jen]]
- [[way of the wuxia]]
- [[way of yin and yang]]

The Monastic Tradition you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again when you reach 6th, 10th, and 17th level.
#### signature techniques
Each Monastic Tradition has a list of Signature Techniques that you learn at the Monk levels as noted in your Tradition's description. These Techniques don't count against your total number of Techniques Known and they cannot be replaced with other Techniques when you gain a level in this class.
### deflect missiles
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

Beginning at 11th level, you can spend 1 Ki Point to use this reaction whenever you are hit by a spell attack.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### extra attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
### stunning strike
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
### ki-empowered strikes
Your spirit empowers your strikes. Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities to nonmagical attacks and damage.
### evasion
Starting at 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a black dragon's acid breath or a [[lightning bolt]] spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
### stillness of mind
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
### spirit of tranquillity
Beginning at 9th level, you can draw upon your spiritual vitality to bolster your physical and mental defenses. When you are forced to make a saving throw, you can spend 1 Ki Point to add your Wisdom modifier to the result of your roll.
### purity of body
At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.
### ki adept
You have mastered favored Ki Techniques. Starting at 11th level, once on your turn, you can use a Technique you know that costs 1 Ki Point, or Flurry of Blows, without spending Ki.
### tongue of the sun and moon
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.
### diamond soul
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.
### timeless body
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.
### empty body
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the [[astral projection]] spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.
### perfect self
You have gained such mastery over your spirit that you can meditate even while performing other simple actions. At 20th level, if you spend 10 minutes meditating or performing only light activities, such as traveling, eating, talking, or exploring, you regain all of your expended Ki Points.
