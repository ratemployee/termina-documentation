Below are the Techniques available to Monks. If a Technique has a prerequisite, you can learn that Technique at the same time you meet its prerequisite.

Each time you gain a Monk level, you can replace one Technique you know with a Technique of your choice.
### 3rd-level techniques
#### arresting strike
When you hit a creature with a melee Martial Arts attack, you can spend 1 Ki Point to stunt its mobility and force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced to zero until the beginning of your next turn.
#### crippling strike
When you hit a creature with a melee Martial Arts attack, you can spend 1 Ki point to cripple its senses and force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is either blinded, deafened, or unable to speak (your choice) until the beginning of your next turn.

On a failed save, it is knocked back from you in a straight line a number of feet equal to five times your Wisdom modifier (minimum: 5 feet), where it falls prone. A creature that is at least one size larger than you has advantage on its saving throw to resist this effect.

#### banishing strike
When you hit a creature with a melee Martial Arts attack, you can expend 3 Ki Points to empower your blow with legendary force, and force the target to make a Charisma saving throw. It takes additional force damage equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failure, and half as much on a success.

If this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, it is shunted to a harmless demiplane where it is incapacitated. The creature reappears in the unoccupied space nearest to the last space it occupied at the end of your next turn.
#### conjure previous life
You summon a specter of your past life to come to your aid. As an action, you can spend 5 Ki points and cast [[summon celestial]] (defender) at 5th level, with the changes below:
- It is a Medium creature that resembles a humanoid Monk, though it does not need to be the same race as you are.
- Its Radiant Mace attacks resemble unarmed strikes.
- When summoned, you can infuse it with a number of Ki Points of your choice, and your Ki Point maximum is reduced by the same amount while it is summoned. It can use the infused Ki to use any Techniques you know, though it cannot use [[#conjure previous life]] again.
#### mystical integrity
Your sense of self and strength of your will are unshakable. You are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form or force you to teleport, unless you wish to be affected.

### 18th-level techniques
#### awaken the third eye
You can open your mind to the Ki that flows through all living things, allowing you to predict the actions of creatures before they happen. You can perform a 1-minute meditative ritual where you expend 8 Ki Points to cast [[foresight]], targeting only yourself. While this effect is active, your Ki Point maximum is reduced by 8. You can end this effect as an action.
#### quivering palm
When you hit a creature with a melee Martial Arts attack, you can spend 5 Ki Points to infuse its soul with vibrations, that last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. While you and the creature are on the same plane of existence, you can use an action to end the vibrations and force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. It is reduced to 0 hit points on a failure and takes 10d10 necrotic damage on a success.

You can only have one creature under the mystical effects of this Technique at a time. Using this Technique on another creature harmlessly ends the effect on any previous creature.
#### word of creation
You can draw on your intimate knowledge of the Ki that flows through all things and speak a divine word of creation. As an action, you can spend 7 Ki points to cast [[divine word]], using Wisdom as your spellcasting modifier.

Once you use your Ki to cast [[divine word]], you must finish a short or long rest before you can cast it in this way again.
