> Though considered barbaric by most wizards, Hemomancy, also known as blood magic, is one of the most powerful and ancient Arcane Traditions. Discovered in ages long forgotten by priests of dark gods, Hemomancers use the power of their own lifeblood to work sinister spells of overwhelming power.

### hemomancy savant
`2nd-LEVEL hemomancy FEATURE`

You learn to copy spells into your spellbook in your blood. When you do so, both your current and maximum hit points are reduced by 1 per level of the spell you copy in place of expending the gold and ink. Any reduction to your maximum hit points from this feature cannot be reduced in any way.

You are also able to learn dark magic unknown to most wizards. You can copy any spell you find in a spell scroll or spellbook into your own spellbook, so long as it deals only poison or necrotic damage. Any spell you gain through this feature must be copied into your spellbook in your blood. It then counts as a wizard spell for you if it wasn't already.
### blood magic
`2nd-LEVEL hemomancy FEATURE`

You learn to use the ancient and sinister magic of Hemomancy to sacrifice your lifeblood to fuel your arcane abilities. As a bonus action, you can regain one expended wizard spell slot by reducing both your current hit points, and maximum hit points by an amount equal to twice the level of the spell slot you wish to regain. This reduction to your hit points cannot be lessened in any way. You cannot use this feature to regain a spell slot higher than 5th-level.

At the end of each long rest, if your maximum hit points have been reduced by one of your Hemomancy features, that reduction is reduced by 1. You can also choose to expend Hit Dice at the end of a long rest, reducing any reduction to your hit point maximum by a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1 hit point).
### vampiric restoration
`6th-LEVEL hemomancy FEATURE`

You can use Hemomancy magic to drain life from your foes. Whenever you deal poison or necrotic damage to a creature with a wizard spell, you can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### sanguine vigor
`10th-LEVEL hemomancy FEATURE`

Your use of blood magic fortifies your body. You gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throw against poison and disease.

Your magic also allows you to regenerate more quickly. At the end of each long rest, you regain additional expended Hit Dice equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1).
### sinister empowerment
`14th-LEVEL hemomancy FEATURE`

You can increase the power of spells that sap the life from others. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher that deals poison or necrotic damage, you can choose to deal maximum damage in place of rolling.

The first time you do so each day, you suffer no adverse effects. However, each subsequent time you use this ability before you finish a long rest, your current and maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to twice the level at which you cast the spell you maximized with this feature.
