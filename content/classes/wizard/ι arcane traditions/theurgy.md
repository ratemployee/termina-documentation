> Not all who serve deities of the upper planes do so as clerics, priests, and paladins. Some wizards focus their great intellect on studies of the divine, and in turn learn to produce divine magic. Wizards who join this school often reside in temples rather than towers, and tend to be more benevolent then their arcane counterparts. In their studies of the upper planes and their magic, these sages often find themselves sympathizing with the causes of the deities they spend their lives studying.

### arcane theologian
`2nd-LEVEL theurgy FEATURE`

You gain access to divine magics unavailable to most wizards. You can copy any cleric spell that you find in other spellbooks or spell scrolls into your spellbook, so long as it does not restore hit points to its target. Any cleric spell you add to your spellbook through this feature count as wizard spells for you.

Moreover, when you gain a wizard level, one of the spells you add to your spellbook can be from the cleric spell list, so long as the spell does not restore hit points to its target.
### channel divinity
`2nd-LEVEL theurgy FEATURE`

You learn to channel divine energy directly from the upper planes, and use it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such Channel Divinity effect: Turn Undead.

Once you use your Channel Divinity to produce one of the divine effects you know, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use any of your Channel Divinities again.

If one of your Channel Divinity effects requires a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your wizard spell save DC. Should you find a scroll, tome, or a willing teacher, you can copy additional Channel Divinities into your spellbook. To do so, you must spend 100 gold on blessed inks and parchment and spend 8 hours copying the prayers into your spellbook.
#### channel divinity: *turn undead*
As an action, you present a holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring undead creatures. Undead within 30 feet that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute, or until they take any damage.

A turned creature must use its turn to move as far away from you as it can. It cannot willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you, or take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it can't move, it can use the Dodge action.
### channel divinity: *harness divine power*
`6th-LEVEL theurgy FEATURE`

As a bonus action, you can grasp a holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended 1st-level spell slot.

At certain wizard levels, you can use this Channel Divinity to regain expended spell slots of higher levels: at 10th level (2nd-level spell slots) and 14th level (3rd-level spell slots).
### divine protection
`10th-LEVEL theurgy FEATURE`

Your knowledge of the upper planes grants you a measure of protection against evil. When a fiend or undead attacks you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Any creature with an Intelligence of 4 or higher is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.
### blessed intervention
`14th-LEVEL theurgy FEATURE`

You can use your knowledge of the divine to implore a being of the upper planes for direct aid.

As an action, you can grasp a holy symbol and beseech that deity for aid, naming a cleric or wizard spell of your choice, of a level for which you have a spell slot. Roll percentile dice. If the result is equal to, or higher than the number on the table below for the level of spell you wish the deity to cast, you are successful. On a success, the spell is instantly cast as if you had cast it without expending a spell slot or components.

Once you use this feature to successfully cast a spell, you must complete 1d6+1 long rests before you can use it again.
