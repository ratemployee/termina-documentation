> Considered by many scholars to be the ninth school of magic, Chronomancy, the magic of time, is only studied by a rare few. Usually, magic that effects the flow of time is forbidden. If a Chronomancer outwardly announces their focus on this magic, they often bring unintended consequences down on themselves in the form of inquisitors seeking to prevent the catastrophe that comes with changing the flow of time.

### chronomancy savant
`2nd-LEVEL school of abjuration FEATURE`

The spells in the Chronomancy Spells table below count as wizard spells for you, and they count as Chronomancy spells in addition to their normal schools of magic.

Moreover, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Chronomancy spell into your spellbook is halved. Finally, each time you gain a wizard level, the spells you add to your spellbook can be from the Chronomancy Spells table below.

### visions of the past
`2nd-LEVEL school of abjuration FEATURE`

You can see echoes of past events in the present. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check while you are in the location where the event took place, you can add double your proficiency bonus to your roll.

Your unique perspective on the flow of time is also source of guidance and insight. You learn the [[guidance]] cantrip, which counts as a wizard spell for you, but it doesn't count against your total number of Cantrips Known.
### arcane foresight
`6th-LEVEL school of abjuration FEATURE`

You have gained the ability to manipulate the flow of time for creatures around you, if only for a moment. When you roll initiative and are not surprised, you can force a creature of your choice within 60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your initiatives are switched for the duration of that combat encounter.

A friendly creature can willingly fail their saving throw.
### paradoxical spellcasting
`10th-LEVEL school of abjuration FEATURE`

Your mastery over the flow of time allows you to borrow arcane power from your future self. As a bonus action on your turn, you can draw a spell slot from a future version of yourself to recover one of your expended spell slots of 5th-level or lower.

You can draw a maximum number of spell slots through this ability with a combined level equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1). At the end of a short or long rest, you can complete a brief ritual where you expend spell slots that you drew from your future self, regaining expended uses of this feature equal to the level of the spell slots you expend.
### master chronomancer
`14th-LEVEL school of abjuration FEATURE`

Your mastery over the magic of time rivals the most powerful creatures of the multiverse, allowing you to undo events in time. When a creature within 60 feet of you ends its turn, you can use your reaction to undo anything that occurred during that creature's turn. The target immediately returns to the space it began its turn, regains any expended spell slots or abilities, and any effects of their actions are undone. The creature then repeats its turn exactly as before, though you are aware of the actions it will take.

Once you use this reaction to rewind time, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again, unless you expend a spell slot of 6th-level or higher to use it an additional time.
