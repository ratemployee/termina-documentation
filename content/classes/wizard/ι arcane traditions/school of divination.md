> The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

### divination savant
`2nd-LEVEL school of divination FEATURE`

The gold and time you must spend to copy a Divination spell into your spellbook is halved.
### portent
`2nd-LEVEL school of divination FEATURE`

Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
### expert divination
`6th-LEVEL school of divination FEATURE`

Casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.
### the third eye
`10th-LEVEL school of divination FEATURE`

You can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

$\quad$ `Darkvision.` You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

$\quad$ `Ethereal Sight.` You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.

$\quad$ `Greater Comprehension.` You can read any language.

$\quad$ `See Invisibility.` You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.
### greater portent
`14th-LEVEL school of divination FEATURE`

The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.
