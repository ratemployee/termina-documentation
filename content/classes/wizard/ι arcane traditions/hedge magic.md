> While almost all wizards study in formal schools under the tutelage of a wise master, some wizards reject traditional arcane schooling and strike out into the world to learn by doing. These rare few who hone their craft out in the wilds are referred to as Hedge Wizards. Though their methods are frowned upon by formal wizarding schools, any archmage worthy of his station will reluctantly recognize that Hedge Wizards are the true masters of the low magics.

Regardless of their background, all Hedge Wizards reject the traditional methods of wizardry.

### cantrip savant
`2nd-LEVEL hedge magic FEATURE`

Your unorthodox relationship with arcane magic allows you to you learn fundamental magics not traditionally associated with wizards. You learn one cantrip of your choice from any spell list. The chosen cantrip counts as a wizard spell for you, but does not count against your total number of Cantrips Known. 

You learn additional cantrips in this way as you gain levels in this class; one each at 6th level, 10th level, and 14th level.
### self-taught
`2nd-LEVEL hedge magic FEATURE`

Your deep understanding of the low magics allows you to add them to your spellbook at a discount. The time you must spend to copy any spell of a level equal to half your proficiency bonus or lower into your spellbook is halved, and the cost of the materials and inks is reduced by 50 gold.
### on the fly
`6th-LEVEL hedge magic FEATURE`

Your skill with basic magic is second to none, allowing you to spontaneously cast low-level spells that you haven't prepared. You can use your action to cast any spell of 2nd-level or lower from your spellbook, even if you don't have the spell prepared, expending the appropriate spell slot. The spell must have a casting time of one action. 

You can cast a spell in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. As you gain levels in this class, you can cast more powerful spells with this feature: 3rd-level spells at 10th level, 4th-level spells at 14th level, and finally 5th-level spells at 18th level.
### hardy magic
`10th-LEVEL hedge magic FEATURE`

Learning your magic out in the wild instead of the controlled environment of a formal school has made you hardier than most wizards. When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can use a reaction to grant yourself a bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: +1). 

You can use this reaction after you roll, but before you determine whether you succeed or fail.
### arcane conservation
`14th-LEVEL hedge magic FEATURE`

Your understanding of arcane fundamentals allows you to recycle the energy of failed spells. Beginning at 14th level, when you cast a wizard spell of 4th-level or lower and the spell fails, you regain one expended spell slot. The spell slot regained must be a lower level than the spell slot used to cast the failed spell. This feature applies to all spells of 4th-level or lower, even if they are cast with a higher level spell slot. 

When you reach 18th level in this class, this ability affects any wizard spells of 5th-level and lower.
