> Wizards spend their lives memorizing esoteric formulas that allow them to produce wondrous arcane effects. However, when produced spontaneously, spells are extremely taxing on the caster. To preserve their power, most wizards learn to cast ritual spells, spells that take longer to produce, but aren't as draining on said wizard's magical stamina. Some wizards, known as Ritualists, dedicate their great intellect to mastery over the deliberate and reliable magic of ritual spellcasting.

### ritual savant
`2nd-LEVEL ritualist FEATURE`

The gold and time you must spend to copy a ritual spell into your spellbook is halved.
### arcane anthology
`2nd-LEVEL ritualist FEATURE`

You have learned to perform arcane rituals not normally known to wizards. You add two 1st-level ritual spells of your choice from any spell list to your spellbook. In addition, you can copy ritual spells from any class's spell list into your spellbook, though you must otherwise follow the normal rules for copying these spells into your spellbook.

Any non-wizard spell you add to your spellbook with this feature counts as a wizard spell for you, but you can only cast it as a ritual, unless you've learned it by some other means.
### accelerated rituals
`6th-LEVEL ritualist FEATURE`

You can accelerate the ritual process for spells with which you are exceptionally familiar. You can cast the ritual version of any 1st-level spell from your spellbook without the additional 10 minute casting time.

You can accelerate a ritual spell in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As you gain levels in this class, you learn to accelerate higher-level ritual spells: 2nd-level rituals at 10th level, 3rd-
level rituals at 14th level, and 4th-level rituals at 18th level.
### formulaic breakthrough
`10th-LEVEL ritualist FEATURE`

Your deep knowledge of ritual magic allows you to ritualize even non-ritual spells. You can cast any 1st-level spell in your spellbook as a ritual so long as it deals no damage and does not require a saving throw.

As you gain levels in this class, you learn to ritualize higher level spells that don't deal damage or require a saving throw: 2nd-level spells at 14th level, and 3rd-level spells at 18th level.
### master ritualist
`14th-LEVEL ritualist FEATURE`

You have reached an unparalleled understanding of ritualistic magic and its applications. You can concentrate on the effects of two ritual spells at once.

The total levels of the spells you concentrate on cannot exceed your Intelligence modifier (minimum: 1st-level), and when you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on your spells, you make one saving throw for both concentration effects.

In addition, whenever you cast the ritual version of a spell that has a duration longer than instantaneous, the duration of the spell's effect is doubled.
