> While many that pursue the study of alchemy find success as artificers, those that balance the study of the arcane arts with the art of alchemy are often wizards, instead. From brews that grow or shrink a creature, to sticky goo that explodes in contact with flameâ€”with access to the right reagents, and a bit of luck, students of alchemy can use their wondrous Arcane Elixirs to aid their allies and leech life away from their enemies.

### alchemical savant
`2nd-LEVEL alchemy FEATURE`

You learn the secrets of arcane alchemy. You gain proficiency with both alchemist's supplies and glassblower's tools. When you reach 10th level in this class, you can add double your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make that uses these tools.
### arcane elixirs
`2nd-LEVEL alchemy FEATURE`

You learn to create potent potions known as Arcane Elixirs. During a long rest, you can spend 1 hour with your alchemist's supplies to create your Arcane Elixirs, which can mimic the effects of certain spells in your spellbook.

You can create an Arcane Elixir that mimics the effect of any spell from your spellbook that has a casting time of one action and targets only one creature. Any Arcane Elixirs you create appear as Tiny glass vials or flasks of iridescent liquid, and reproduce the spell effect at its lowest possible level.

As an action, a creature can drink an Elixir, administer an Elixir to a willing creature within 5 feet, or throw an Elixir at a point within 30 feet to produce its spell's effect at the point of impact. If an Elixir's spell effect requires concentration, the creature that drinks it must concentrate on the effect. Elixirs use your wizard spell save DC and spellcasting modifier.

During each long rest, you can create a number of Arcane Elixirs with a combined spell level equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. At the end of your next long rest, any unused Elixirs become inert and unusable.
### efficient arcana
`6th-LEVEL alchemy FEATURE`

Your alchemical knowledge and skill has improved. Starting at 6th level, you can spend 10 minutes with your alchemist's supplies, which can be during a short rest, to recycle one of your unused Arcane Elixirs, changing its effect to another spell of your choice of the same level from your spellbook.

Moreover, you can use an action to create an Arcane Elixir of a spell you have prepared, expending the spell slot as you normally would. An Arcane Elixir of the spell then appears in your empty hand. A spell used to create an Elixir in this way must meet all the requirements for being an Arcane Elixir.
### experimental fortitude
`10th-LEVEL alchemy FEATURE`

At 10th level, your work with strange and wondrous arcane reagents has fortified your body. You gain resistance to both acid and poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws to resist being poisoned.
### greater homunculus
`14th-LEVEL alchemy FEATURE`

Upon reaching 14th level, you achieve the ultimate goal of every alchemist, the creation of artificial life. You learn the [[clone]] spell. Using your alchemist's supplies, you can cast a special version of [[clone]] by spending 8 hours, which can be during a long rest, molding organic material into an exact copy of yourself. All of your clone's game statistics are the same as yours, but you share Hit Dice and spell slots.

In combat, your clone shares your initiative and acts on your turn. However, it can only take the Dodge action unless you use your bonus action to issue it a telepathic command.

If your clone is reduced to 0 hit points, it is immediately destroyed, and reverts to a pile of raw organic materials.
