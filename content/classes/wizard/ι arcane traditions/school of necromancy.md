> The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.
$\quad$ 
Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

### necromancy savant
`2nd-LEVEL school of necromancy FEATURE`

The gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.
### undead savant
`2nd-LEVEL school of necromancy FEATURE`

You learn to create undead companions. You add the [[find familiar]] and [[unseen servant]] spells into your spellbook, if they are not there already. For you, these spells are necromancy spells, and you can replace either spell's material component with a drop of your blood or grave dirt when you cast either spell as a ritual. In addition, when you cast either one of these spells, the creature you create is known as your Undead Servant. It has the undead creature type and a number of hit points equal to five times your wizard level.

Additionally, when you cast a necromancy spell of 1st-level or higher and your Undead Servant is within 30 feet of you, you can choose for the spell to originate from your Undead Servant instead of you. If the spell would deal damage to a creature that is not an undead or construct, you can use your reaction to tether that damage to your Servant. When you do so, your Undead Servant gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt to one of the spell's targets.
### cobble anatomy
`6th-LEVEL school of necromancy FEATURE`

You learn to exploit the flexibility of corpses. When you cast a necromancy spell that creates or summons one or more undead while one of your Undead Servants is within range of the spell, you can cobble all of the creatures together into an Undead Abomination in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. When you do so, your Undead Servant is destroyed and you can't recast the spell used to create your Undead Servant while your Undead Abomination remains.

Choose one creature that would be created or summoned by the spell to be your Undead Abomination. The remaining creatures that would be created or summoned are destroyed, and your Undead Abomination gains the following benefits from each destroyed creature, including your Undead Servant:
- A number of hit points equal to that of each destroyed creature.
- The benefits of any resistances, immunities, senses, and traits a destroyed creature possessed.
- A one-category increase to its size category for each creature (to a maximum of Huge).
- A 5-foot increase to the reach of its melee weapon attacks for each creature (to a maximum of 15 feet).
- It gains the Multiattack action if it doesn't have it already. The number of attacks it can make when it uses its Multiattack is equal to the number of destroyed undead + the number of attacks it could normally make. If a destroyed undead could take any special actions as part of its Multiattack, the Abomination can take one of those actions each time it uses its Multiattack.

If the spell you cast sets any limitations on the creature's duration or control, those limitations remain.
### necronomicon
`10th-LEVEL school of necromancy FEATURE`

The necromantic energy stored in your spellbook grants its own undead resilience. Your spellbook is immune to all damage types except for radiant, it can only be destroyed if you are not carrying it or touching it, and you have resistance to necrotic damage while it is in your possession.

Additionally, you can cast a necromancy spell of 3rd-level or lower as a ritual, even if it doesn't have the ritual tag. Once you cast a ritual spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
### carcinogenic corpse
`14th-LEVEL school of necromancy FEATURE`

Your abominations learn to digest festering meat to develop strength. As an action, you can command an Undead Abomination to consume a corpse or another undead within its melee range. When you do so, the Abomination takes its Multiattack action against the target if it is unwilling to be consumed. Corpses, willing undead, and unwilling undead reduced to 0 hit points are immediately consumed.

For each creature that your Abomination consumes, it regains 10 hit points and develops an abscess. When you cast a necromancy spell of 1st-level or higher while your Abomination is within 30 feet of you, you can cause an abscess to burst (no action required). Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the Abomination must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take necrotic damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier + the spell's level.
