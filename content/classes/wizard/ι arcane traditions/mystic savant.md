> Unlike most other arcane traditions, mystic savants do not belong to a formalized institution, instead sharing a philosophy that, to master arcana, one must master every individual aspect of it. Their contemporaries call them “universalists” or “holistics,” but they are savants by any definition. The skill of spellcasting comes naturally to them, so while other wizards refine a specific school of magic, mystic savants master an array of cross-school stratagems to help them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

### arcane strategist
`2nd-LEVEL mystic savant FEATURE`

You learn stratagems that are fueled by special dice called battle dice.
#### battle dice
You have two battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. 

Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below:

| **Wizard Level** | **Battle Dice** |
| :--------------: | :-------------: |
|       2nd        |       2d6       |
|       3rd        |       2d8       |
|       7th        |       3d8       |
|       13th       |      3d10       |
|       19th       |      4d10       |
#### using battle dice
Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to use a stratagem of your choice. Your stratagem options are detailed below.
#### stratagems
You learn three stratagems of your choice, which are detailed under “Stratagems," below. Many stratagems enhance a spell in some way. You can use only one stratagem per spell. 

You learn two additional stratagems of your choice at 6th level and one additional stratagem of your choice at 10th and 14th level. Each time you learn new stratagems, you can also replace one stratagem you know with a different one.
### bonus proficiency
`2nd-LEVEL mystic savant FEATURE`

You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Religion.
### versatile memory
`6th-LEVEL mystic savant FEATURE`

You can use your action to exchange one spell you have prepared for another of the same level or lower in your spellbook. 

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
### arcanist's assessment
`10th-LEVEL mystic savant FEATURE`

You can use your action to appraise the spellcasting prowess of a creature you can see within 30 feet. Make an ability check using your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s spellcasting ability check. If the creature doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, it rolls a d20 instead. If you succeed, you learn if the creature has the Spellcasting, Innate Spellcasting, or Pact Magic features, and whether the creature can cast spells of a higher level than you can cast. 

Regardless of whether the target succeeds or fails, it knows you have assessed its magical capabilities. You can’t use this ability on the same target for 24 hours. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### font of percipience
`14th-LEVEL mystic savant FEATURE`

You can use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to regain a number of your expended battle dice up to the level of the spell slot expended. When you do, you can choose a stratagem you know and replace it with a different stratagem.

## stratagems
The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.
### arcane warding
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can expend and roll one battle die as a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to the level of spell slot expended to cast the spell + the result of the battle die. You lose any temporary hit points gained from this stratagem after 10 minutes.
### eldritch aegis
When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet takes damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to expend and roll one battle die, reducing the damage taken by the result.
### flash of brilliance
When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can expend one battle die to add it to the check. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but before the GM says whether the result was a success or failure.
### mystic counsel
You can use a bonus action and expend one battle die to give counsel to a creature that can hear you within 30 feet of you. Once in the next minute when the creature makes a saving throw against a spell it can choose to roll the battle die and add the result to the saving throw.
### mystic defense
When you make a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to expend and roll one battle die to add its result to the saving throw. You can choose to use this stratagem after the saving throw is rolled but before the GM says whether the result was a success or failure.
### potent casting
When you roll damage for a spell you cast, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action. When you do, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum: one) and must use the new rolls.
### precision spell
When you make a spell attack roll against a creature, you can expend one battle die to add it to the roll as a bonus action. You can use this stratagem before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the spell attack are applied.
### quick thinking
When you make an ability check to determine initiative, you can expend and roll one battle die to add its result to your initiative roll. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but before the GM determines initiative order.
### sorcerous spread
When you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your bonus action to choose another creature within 5 feet of the target, then expend and roll a battle die. That chosen creature takes damage equal to the level of spell slot expended casting the spell + the result of the battle die. The type of damage is the same as that taken by the original target of the spell.
### spellcaster's sting
When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you cast of 1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to expend and roll a battle die. The creature takes force damage equal to the level of spell slot expended casting the spell + the result of the battle die.
### spell sundering
When you deal damage to a creature concentrating on a spell, you can use your bonus action to expend and roll one battle die, adding its result to the damage dealt. If the creature must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, that saving throw has disadvantage.
### unbreakable concentration
When you make a saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can expend and roll one battle die to add its result to the saving throw. You can choose to use this stratagem after the saving throw is rolled but before the GM says whether the result was a success or failure.
