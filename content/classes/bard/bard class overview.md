### bardic inspiration
Starting at 1st level, you can inspire heroism with both word and music. When you or a creature that can hear you within 60 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use a reaction to expend a Bardic Inspiration die and add it to the result of its roll. You can use this reaction after the creature rolls, but before you know if it succeeds or fails. You can also pre-emptively provide a creature with a Bardic Inspiration die as a bonus action.

Your Bardic Inspiration die begins as a d6, and increases in size when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Bardic Inspiration column of the Bard table above.

You have a number of Bardic Inspiration dice equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1 die), and you regain all of your expended dice when you finish a short or long rest.
### spellcasting
Also at 1st level, you learn to use your performative ability to draw upon the song of creation and produce wondrous spells.
#### cantrips (0-level spells)
You know two cantrips of your choice from the [[bard spell list]]. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.
#### spell slots
The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [[cure wounds]] and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast [[cure wounds]] using either slot.
#### spells known of 1st-level and higher
At 1st level, you know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[bard spell list]].

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st- or 2nd-level.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells, as your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music. You use Charisma whenever a bard spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast, and when making an attack roll with one.

$\quad$ **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
$\quad$ **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
#### ritual casting
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.
#### spellcasting focus
You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
### jack of all trades
At 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
### song of rest
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains additional hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.

In place of regaining these additional hit points, a creature can choose to reduce its current level of exhaustion by 1.
### folklore
Also at 2nd level, your travels and experiences help you glean various bits of knowledge. You gain proficiency with two skills, musical instruments, or tools. You can learn to speak, read, and write one language of your choice in place of one or both of these skill, instrument, or tool proficiencies.

As you gain levels in this class, you learn more Folklore. You gain proficiency with one skill, musical instrument, tool, or you learn another language of your choice at 7th, 10th, 14th, and 20th level.
### bardic tradition
At 3rd level, choose the Bardic Tradition that best represents the varied skills, talents, and knowledge you have gained in your many travels:

- [[conspirator]]
- [[fool]]
- [[loremaster]]
- [[maskmaker]]
- [[mesmer]]
- [[skald]]
- [[sword dancer]]

Your choice of tradition grants features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 5th, 11th, and 15th level in this class.
### magical secrets
In your various travels, you have plundered magical knowledge from an assortment of disciplines. Also at 3rd level, you learn two spells from any class' spell list, which must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You can cast any of your Magical Secrets of 5th-level or lower once, at its lowest level, without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. You can also cast Magical Secrets spells with any spell slots you have.

You learn two additional Magical Secrets spells of your choice when you reach 6th level, and again at 10th level, 14th level, and 18th level in this class.

Unlike your other bard spells, any bard spells that you learn as a Magical Secret through this feature cannot be switched out for another bard spell when you gain a level in this class.
### expertise
At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.
### ability score improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### font of inspiration
Beginning at 5th level, you can draw bardic power directly from the Song of Creation itself. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to regain a number of expended Bardic Inspiration dice equal to the level of the slot expended.
### countercharm
At 6th level, you can use your bardic performance to disrupt other spellcasters. When a creature you can hear within 60 feet casts a spell that has a verbal component, you can use your reaction to play a discordant melody and expend one or more Bardic Inspiration dice.

If the number of Bardic Inspiration dice you expend is equal to or higher than the level at which the spell was cast, the spell instantly fails and has no effect.

If the spell is of a level higher than the number of Bardic Inspiration dice you expended, roll the Bardic Inspiration dice. If the total is equal to or higher than 10 + the level of the spell, then the spell instantly fails and has no effect.
### superior inspiration
At 20th level, when you use your bonus action to give an ally Bardic Inspiration, you can instead give two allies Bardic Inspiration. You still expend only one Bardic Inspiration die as normal when doing this.
### mythic secrets
Also at 20th level, you unlock some of the most powerful and secret magics of the multiverse. You learn four cantrips and four spells from any class, as you would with your Magical Secrets feature.
