> Bards who count themselves among this Tradition use crude stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain and cajole audiences. Where other bards might seek out forgotten lore or tales of bravery, Fools recount embarrassing and satirical stories to undermine the plans of those in power. Their sharp wit and acrobatics make them slippery opponents in battle.

### satirical theatrics
`3RD-LEVEL FOOL TRADITION FEATURE`

You gain the skills to pass as a bumbling nincompoop. You gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Sleight of Hand. Whenever you make an ability check with either skill, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.
### cutting words
`3RD-LEVEL FOOL TRADITION FEATURE`

You know just the right thing to say to distract, confuse, and sap the confidence of others. As a reaction when a creature that can hear you within 60 feet makes a damage roll, ability check, or attack roll, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die, roll it, and subtract the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can use this reaction after the creature rolls, but before it is determined if its roll succeeds or fails, or it deals damage.
### tumbling fool
`3RD-LEVEL FOOL TRADITION FEATURE`

You have learned to move about in a strange yet entertaining manner. You can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. Whenever you take the Dash action, you gain the benefits listed below until the end of your current turn:
- Opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.
- You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can move through the space of any creature equal to you in size, or larger, without expending extra movement.
- You reduce falling damage you take by an amount equal to your level + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
### sharp wit
`5th-LEVEL FOOL TRADITION FEATURE`

You can use sarcasm and wit to distract those who would do you harm. When a creature you can see within 60 feet targets you with an attack, you can use your Cutting Words reaction without expending a use of your Bardic Inspiration.

Also, whenever you use your Cutting Words reaction, and the target misses with its attack or fails its ability check as a result, you can choose for it to take psychic damage equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier.
### wondrous tumbler
`11th-LEVEL FOOL TRADITION FEATURE`

You can embellish your natural acrobatic talents with bardic magic. When you use the Dash action, you can expend one Bardic Inspiration die to gain one of the following benefits:

$\quad$ `Disappearing Act.` You turn invisible and can move about without making a sound for 10 minutes. This invisibility ends if you damage a creature or force it to make a saving throw.

$\quad$ `Misdirection.` You disappear, only to instantly reappear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet.
### fool's luck
`15th-LEVEL FOOL TRADITION FEATURE`

You can snatch defeat from victory to regain some of your bardic magic. When the DM calls for you to make an ability check or forces you to make a saving throw and you succeed, you can instead choose to fail in comical fashion, and regain one of your expended Bardic Inspiration dice.
