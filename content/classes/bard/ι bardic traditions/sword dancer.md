### elegant duelist
`3RD-LEVEL sword dancer TRADITION FEATURE`

You incorporate deadly blades and combat techniques into your performances. You gain proficiency with scimitars, and if you are proficient with a melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for any bard spell you know.

You also gain proficiency in Performance, and whenever you would make a Charisma (Performance) check, you can make a Dexterity (Performance) check that incorporates a deadly bladed weapon you are proficient with instead.
### fighting style
`3RD-LEVEL sword dancer TRADITION FEATURE`

You gain one of the Fighting Styles listed below. You cannot learn the same Fighting Style more than once, even if you are able to learn another Fighting Style.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace this Fighting Style with another option from the same list.

$\quad$ `Classical Swordplay.` While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to both your attack rolls and to your Armor Class, so long as you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield.

$\quad$ `Dual Wielding.` When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make a single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your action instead of your bonus action, adding your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

$\quad$ `Dueling.` When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with it.

$\quad$ `Featherweight Fighting.` While you are wielding only light weapons and nothing else, your speed increases by 10 feet. You also gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with light weapons, so long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield.

$\quad$ `Thrown Weapon Fighting.` You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. Moreover, when you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll of that attack.

$\quad$ `Versatile Fighting.` While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you can choose to wield your weapon one or two-handed until the start of your next turn. When wielding it one-handed you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and to your Armor Class. Wielding it two-handed, you gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls instead.
### elegant exploits
`3RD-LEVEL sword dancer TRADITION FEATURE`

You have studied various exploits to improve your deadly bardic performances. You gain the following features:
#### exploits
You learn two [[martial exploits|martial exploits]] of your choice from those available to the Fighter class. The Exploits Known column of the Blade Dancer Exploits table shows when you learn more Martial Exploits of your choice.

To use an Exploit, you expend a Bardic Inspiration die. You can only use one Exploit per ability check, attack, or saving throw. When a Martial Exploit refers to an Exploit Die, you use your Bardic Inspiration die.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Exploit you know with another Martial Exploit of your choice of the same degree.
#### high degree
Your level in this class limits the Exploits you are able to perform. This limit is reflected in the High Degree column of the Blade Dancer Exploits table. In order to learn a Martial Exploit, it must be equal to your High Degree on the Blade Dancer Exploits table, or lower.
#### saving throws
If an Exploit requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is calculated as follows:
  
 $\quad$ **Exploit save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

### extra attack
`5th-LEVEL sword dancer TRADITION FEATURE`

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one Bard cantrip you know in place of one of these attacks.
### deadly flourish
`11th-LEVEL sword dancer TRADITION FEATURE`

You wield your chosen weapons with deadly precision. When you deal damage with a melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can roll your Bardic Inspiration die in place of the weapon's normal damage die, unless its damage die is higher.

In addition, when you use an Exploit as part of your action, you can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action.
### master of blades
`15th-LEVEL sword dancer TRADITION FEATURE`

You are a master of your deadly yet beautiful craft. Once per turn, you can use an Exploit you know without expending a Bardic Inspiration die, rolling a d6 in its place.

Finally, at the end of each long rest, you can spend time practicing your techniques and replace one Martial Exploit you know with another Martial Exploit of your choice.
