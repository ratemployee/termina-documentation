> The bards known as Conspirators use their skills and talents for their own benefit. They abuse the trust most folks have for bards and work their way into positions where they can find incriminating secrets to use for blackmail. These narcissistic bards often masquerade as practitioners of other Traditions, operating in secret to accumulate wealth and influence, and rarely, if ever, reveal their true motivations to others.

### cunning influence
`3RD-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

You become an expert at manipulating creatures that make the mistake of trusting you. You gain proficiency in Deception and with two of the following tools of your choice: disguise kits, forgery kits, poisoner's kit, or thieves' tools.

Whenever you make an ability check that uses any of the skill or tool proficiencies listed above, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.
### psychic assault
`3RD-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

Your strikes assault body and mind. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die to deal additional psychic damage to the creature equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die.
### seeds of terror
`3RD-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

You can lace innocent speech with insidious bardic magic to inspire terror and paranoia. If you speak with a humanoid for at least 1 minute, you can expend one Bardic Inspiration die and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of a creature of your choice that it can see for 1 hour. This effect ends early if the frightened creature or its allies are attacked or damaged by you or your allies.

Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the target is unaware that you tried to magically influence its feelings.
### devious strike
`5TH-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

Once per turn, you can deal an additional 2d6 damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack if another enemy of the target other than you is within 5 feet of it, so long as that enemy isn't incapacitated and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

This additional damage increases at certain levels in this class: at 9th level (3d6), 13th level (4d6), and 17th level (5d6).
### visage of shadows
`5TH-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

You can use sinister magic to trap the visage of other people who fall victim to you. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to capture its Shadow.

As an action, you can expend this Shadow and magically transform so that you resemble that humanoid as it looked in life. The effect lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as an action.

While you are transformed by a Shadow, you have access to any information that humanoid would have shared with a casual acquaintance, such as general details on its personal life and background, but not any secret information.

Creatures can attempt to see through this transformation by using their action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC.
### mental anguish
`11TH-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

You weave manipulative magic into every strike. When you use your [[#psychic assault]] feature, you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Also, when you hit a creature that is frightened of you with a weapon attack, you can end the frightened condition for it and turn your weapon attack into an automatic critical hit.
### sinister manipulation
`15TH-LEVEL CONSPIRATOR TRADITION FEATURE`

Your manipulative magic knows no bounds. As an action, you can whisper into the ear of a creature that can both hear and understand you within 5 feet and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a failed save, the creature believes that you know of its darkest secret, though you have no knowledge of it. It is then charmed by you until you or your allies attack or damage it.

While charmed this way, a creature will secretly aid you in any way it can, short of fighting or risking its life for you.

You can only have one creature charmed in this way at a time, and attempting to charm another creature in this way ends this effect for the previous creature. You can also end these effects on the charmed creature as an action.
