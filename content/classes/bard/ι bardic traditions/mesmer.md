### mesmerizing presence
`3RD-LEVEL mesmer TRADITION FEATURE`

Your words are laced with seductive fey magic. You learn the [[friends]], [[charm person]], and [[command]] spells, but they do not count against your total number of Cantrips Known or Spells Known.

Also, if you perform for, or speak with, a creature for at least 1 minute, you can expend one Bardic Inspiration die to cast [[charm person]] targeting that creature. When you cast the spell in this way, the target is unaware that you attempted to influence it with magic.
### wondrous performance
`3RD-LEVEL mesmer TRADITION FEATURE`

You can momentarily enhance your appearance with bardic magic. As a bonus action, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die to empower yourself with fey magic and choose any number of creatures, up to your Charisma modifier, that can see you within 60 feet.

Creatures gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and can instantly move up to their speed.

This special movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
### greater performance
`5th-LEVEL mesmer TRADITION FEATURE`

The seductive power of your bardic magic has grown. When you use Wondrous Performance, it lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you are incapacitated or you choose to end it.

While your Wondrous Performance lasts, you can use each subsequent bonus action to either grant a creature the effects of Wondrous Performance, or you can cast [[charm person]] or [[command]] without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way, these spells only last until the end of your Performance.
### reflexive charm
`5th-LEVEL mesmer TRADITION FEATURE`

You can attempt to distract your foes with whimsical magic. As a reaction when a creature you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can add one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to your Armor Class against that attack.
### mantle of protection
`11th-LEVEL mesmer TRADITION FEATURE`

Your performances exude a powerful aura of protective fey magic. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you have advantage on saving throws to resist the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and stunned conditions while your Wondrous Performance lasts.
### fey presence
`15th-LEVEL mesmer TRADITION FEATURE`

The bardic magic you draw from the Feywild has changed you, giving you a lovely yet fierce appearance. When you force a creature that can see you to make a saving throw to resist the charmed or frightened condition while your Wondrous Performance is active, it has disadvantage on its roll.
