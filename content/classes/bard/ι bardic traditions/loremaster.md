> The bards known as Loremasters travel the world collecting bits of knowledge about everything they can. From scholarly tomes and religious texts to tavern tales and superstitions of local peasants, these travelers value stories of all kinds. The loyalty of these bards lies above all in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or the tenets of a deity.

### additional magical secrets
`3RD-LEVEL loremaster TRADITION FEATURE`

Your knowledge of various magical traditions exceeds even that of your fellow Bards. You learn one additional Magical Secret spell of your choice.

Also, whenever you learn additional Magical Secrets, you learn three spells of your choice, instead of the normal two.
### esoteric lore
`3RD-LEVEL loremaster TRADITION FEATURE`

In your many wanderings, you have learned how to find information that otherwise might remain hidden. You gain proficiency in the Arcana and History skills, and you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on any checks you make with these skills as a 10.
### potent performer
`5th-LEVEL loremaster TRADITION FEATURE`

Whenever you cast a Bard spell that deals thunder or psychic damage or restores hit points to a creature, you gain a bonus to the damage roll or the number of hit points restored by the spell equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.
### wondrous success
`11th-LEVEL loremaster TRADITION FEATURE`

Your skills are beyond reproach. When you use your Bardic Inspiration to add to an ability check, you can invoke a magical success and turn the creature's d20 roll into a 20. If the target succeeds, it does so in an overtly magical way.

Once you use your Bardic Inspiration in this way, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.
### burst of inspiration
`15th-LEVEL loremaster TRADITION FEATURE`

Your speech and song are laced with powerful bardic magic, inspiring all who hear you. When you use your Bardic Inspiration reaction on a creature other than yourself, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of your target can add one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make before the beginning of your next turn.
