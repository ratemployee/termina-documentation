> Bards of this Tradition are no strangers to adventure. Unlike other bards that sing the tales of heroes from ages long past, Skalds seek to inspire new legends. They seek out bands of adventurers and potential heroes, hoping to use their magic to inspire them to great feats worthy of song and legend.

### bardic warrior
`3RD-LEVEL skald TRADITION FEATURE`

In your desire to stand among the heroes of legend you have learned to hold your own in battle. You gain proficiency with martial weapons, shields, and heavy armor.

Also, when you are wielding a weapon or shield in both of your hands, your voice counts as a musical instrument for the purposes of casting Bard spells or using other features.
### combat inspiration
`3RD-LEVEL skald TRADITION FEATURE`

You use your bardic magic to inspire feats of valor in battle. When you or a creature that can hear you within 60 feet hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and add the result to the damage roll.
### extra attack
`5th-LEVEL skald TRADITION FEATURE`

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one Bard cantrip you know in place of one of these attacks.
### gallant charge
`5th-LEVEL skald TRADITION FEATURE`

When you roll initiative, you can expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to rally a heroic charge. You, and any creatures of your choice within 15 feet that can hear you gain a bonus to their initiative rolls equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration.

You can't use this feature when incapacitated or surprised.
### ringing strikes
`11th-LEVEL skald TRADITION FEATURE`

You empower your strikes with bardic magic. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal bonus thunder damage equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.

Also, you can choose for your Combat Inspiration bonus damage to be thunder in place of the weapon's damage type.
### heroic ballad
`15th-LEVEL skald TRADITION FEATURE`

Your words motivate others to ever greater feats of gallantry. When you use Combat Inspiration, you can also grant the target temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier (minimum: 1).
