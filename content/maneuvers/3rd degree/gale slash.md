`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or DEX 15

In place of an attack, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to rend the air in front of you with a melee weapon, forcing targets in an adjacent 20-foot cone to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, targets take slashing damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die spent + either your Strength or Dexterity modifier. On a successful save, targets take half as much damage.
