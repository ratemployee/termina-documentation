`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 15

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike at the head, weakening its ability to think. For 1 minute, its thoughts are muddled and whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration, it must roll a d6 and subtract the result from its roll. 

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
