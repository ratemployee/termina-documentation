As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die to attempt to drive a creature within 5 feet into a fit of primal fear, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures as enemies for the next minute. Each time it takes damage, it repeats the saving throw, ending this effect on a success. 

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target of an attack or spell, it must choose its target at random from among the creatures it can see within range. 

If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, it must make that attack if it is able to.
