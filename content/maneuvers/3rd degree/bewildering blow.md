`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or DEX 15

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and strike with extreme force, dealing additional damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die and forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior, using the table below:

| **d10** | **Behavior**                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    1    | It uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. It does not take an action this turn |
|   2-5   | It does not move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                 |
|   6-7   | It uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature in its reach, It does nothing this turn.         |
|   8-9   | It can act and move normally                                                                                                                                                |
|   10    | It lays prone on the ground and takes no further actions or movement this turn.                                                                                             |
This effect lasts for 1 minute, but the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, instantly ending the effects of this Exploit on a successful save.
