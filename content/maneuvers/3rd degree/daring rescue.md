As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend one Exploit Die and move up to twice your walking speed, so long as you end the movement within 5 feet of the downed creature.

The creature can then expend one Hit Die to regain hit points equal to one Hit Die roll + its Constitution modifier. It also gains a number of temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Exploit Die for each opportunity attack you provoked as part of the movement granted to you by this Exploit.
