`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 15

When you hit with a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with overwhelming force, dealing additional damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer the following effects for 1 minute: 
- Its speed is halved and it cannot take reactions. Its Armor Class is reduced by 2. 
- It has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. 
- On its turn it can only take an action or a bonus action. It cannot make more than one attack during its turn. 
- It can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending these effects on a success. 

This Exploit's effects do not stack with the [[slow]] spell.
