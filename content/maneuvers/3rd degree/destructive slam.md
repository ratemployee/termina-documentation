`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 15

In place of an attack, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and strike the ground at your feet, forcing all creatures in an adjacent 20-foot cube to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + your Strength modifier and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. Objects in this area take the maximum amount of damage. 

Moreover, the area of the 20-foot cube becomes difficult terrain until a creature takes 1 minute to clear it.
