`PREREQUISITEs`
WIS 15

As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to signal your allies to fight as a pack. Until the end of your next turn, creatures of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet have advantage on attack rolls, so long as a conscious allied creature is within 5 feet of their target. 

You can use a bonus action on your next turn to extend the effects of this Exploit to the end of the turn after that, though you do not need to expend an Exploit Die when you do so. 

You cannot maintain this Exploit longer than 1 minute.
