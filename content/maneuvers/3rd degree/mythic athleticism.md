`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or CON 15

As a bonus action, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to enter a heightened state of physical performance which you must concentrate on as if you were concentrating on a spell. You gain the benefits listed below:
- Whenever you make a Strength or Constitution check, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. 
- Your walking speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Strength modifier (minimum: 5 feet). 
- You count as one size larger for the purposes of carrying capacity and the size of creatures that you can grapple. 
- Both your long and high jump distances double, even if that distance would exceed your remaining movement.

The effects last for 10 minutes for each Exploit Die spent as part of this Exploit, and end early if you are incapacitated.
