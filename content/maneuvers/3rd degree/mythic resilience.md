`PREREQUISITEs`
CON 15

When you take damage from an effect you can see, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to reduce the incoming damage. For each Exploit Die you expend you roll three Exploit Dice, adding your Constitution modifier to the total of all the dice. You reduce the damage by the total. 

If the total rolled exceeds the amount of damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining amount.
