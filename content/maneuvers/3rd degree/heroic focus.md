As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to enter a heightened state of focus, which you must concentrate on as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 1 minute, or until you lose concentration, you gain the following benefits:
- Your speed is doubled.
- You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class.
- You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- You gain an additional action on each of your turns. It can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, Search, or Use an Object action.

When the effect ends, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Exploit save DC, or you can't move or take actions until after the end of your next turn.

This Exploit's effects do not stack with the [[haste]] spell.
