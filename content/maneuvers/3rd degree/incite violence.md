`PREREQUISITEs`
INT or CHA 15

As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die and whisper violent words to a creature that can understand you within 5 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die and instantly use its reaction to make a melee attack against a creature of your choice within its reach. If no other creature is within its reach, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.
