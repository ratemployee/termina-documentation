`PREREQUISITEs`
INT or CHA 15

You can expend an Exploit Die and spend 1 hour to recruit a humanoid Mercenary from a settlement you currently occupy. For this Exploit to work, there must be a willing humanoid, such as a bounty hunter, adventurer, or other sellsword in a settlement of significant size, as determined by the DM.

You choose to recruit a Brute or Scout, which determines certain traits in their stat block. They use the Mercenary stat block below, and roll their own initiative in combat. On their turn, they do their best to follow any orders you have given. If not, they will defend themselves to the best of their ability.

The Mercenary remains in your service until you dismiss them, they abandon you, or they die. You do not regain the Exploit Die spent on this Exploit until they leave your service.

You can only have one Mercenary in your service at a time. Recruiting another causes others to abandon you.
