When you score a critical hit, you can expend an Exploit Die to let out a cry that can be heard up to 300 feet away. You and a number of creatures of your choice who can hear you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum: 1) gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier.
