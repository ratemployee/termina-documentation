`PREREQUISITEs`
INT or WIS 15

You can expend an Exploit Die to spend 10 minutes focused on a person, object, or location you can see, after which, you remember a piece of lore about the thing you focused on.

This lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The more information you have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you seem to remember about it.
