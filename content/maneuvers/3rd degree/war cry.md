As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and issue a mighty cry, forcing creatures of your choice that can hear you in an adjacent 30-foot cone to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they drop whatever they are holding and are frightened of you for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn and does not have line of sight to you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
