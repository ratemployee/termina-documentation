`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or DEX 15

In place of an attack, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and fire one piece of ammunition in a line, out to the weapon's normal range. Creatures in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Die you spent + either your Strength or Dexterity modifier and fall prone. On a success, they take half that damage and don't fall prone.
