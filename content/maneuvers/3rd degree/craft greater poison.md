`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with poisoner's kit

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and use a poisoner's kit to craft a vial of Greater Poison, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you can't regain the Exploit Dice you spent in its creation until you expend this poison.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to expend the vial and apply it to one weapon or a piece of ammunition it is holding. On its next hit, the weapon deals additional poison damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the following effects for 1 minute:

- It has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- Its speed is halved, and it cannot take reactions.
- It takes poison damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die at the end of each of its turns.

The poisoned creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending these effects on a success.
