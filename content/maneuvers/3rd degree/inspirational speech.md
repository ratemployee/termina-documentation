CHA 15

You can expend an Exploit Die and spend 1 minute giving an inspirational speech to a number of creatures that can hear you equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. At the end of this speech, targets gain temporary hit points equal to your level.

While the temporary hit points from this Exploit last, the creatures have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.
