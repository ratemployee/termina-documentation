`PREREQUISITEs`
INT or CHA 15

You can expend an Exploit Die and spend 1 hour to recruit a humanoid Informant from a settlement you currently occupy. For this Exploit to work, there must be a willing humanoid, such as an urchin, criminal, thief, spy, or other rapscallions in a settlement of significant size, as determined by the DM.

They won't aid you in combat or risk their life for you, but they will gather information, rumors, news, and secrets in that settlement. During each long rest, they will seek you out and deliver this information if you are in the same settlement.

Your Informant remains in your service until you dismiss them or they die. However, you do not regain the Exploit Die spent on this Exploit until they leave your service.

Having more than one Informant in a settlement increases the accuracy and secrecy of information they can gather.
