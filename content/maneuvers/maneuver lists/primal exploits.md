Below are the Exploits available to Barbarians. If an Exploit has a prerequisite, like a minimum Ability Score or level, you can learn it at the same time you meet the prerequisites.
### first degree exploits
Exploits of the 1st degree are minor techniques slightly more complicated than swinging a weapon. They can be learned by warriors with modest training and have no level prerequisite.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #primalexploit AND #firstdegree 
SORT file.name ASC
```

### second degree exploits
Exploits of the 2nd degree represent the peak of martial skill and ability achievable by warriors without dedicated training. These can be learned by any Barbarian of 5th level or higher.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #primalexploit AND #seconddegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### third degree exploits
3rd degree Exploits are feats of savagery, and can be learned by Barbarians of 9th level or higher. Each 3rd-degree Exploit you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #primalexploit AND #thirddegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### fourth degree exploits
Exploits of the 4th degree can only be learned by Barbarians of 13th level or higher, and each 4th-degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #primalexploit AND #fourthdegree 
SORT file.name ASC
```

### fifth degree exploits
Exploits of the 5th degree are primal feats that rival mythic monsters and demigods. These Exploits can only be learned by Barbarians of 17th level or higher. Each 5th-degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #primalexploit AND #fifthdegree 
SORT file.name ASC
```
