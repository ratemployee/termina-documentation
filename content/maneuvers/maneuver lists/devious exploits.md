Below are the Exploits available to Rogues. If an Exploit has a prerequisite, like a minimum Ability Score or level, you can learn it at the same time you meet the prerequisites.
### first degree exploits
Exploits of the 1st degree are minor techniques slightly more complicated than swinging a weapon. They can be learned by warriors with modest training and have no level prerequisite.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #deviousexploit  AND #firstdegree 
SORT file.name ASC
```

### second degree exploits
Exploits of the 2nd degree represent the peak of roguish skill and ability achievable by those without dedicated training. These can be learned by any Rogue of 5th level or higher.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #deviousexploit AND #seconddegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### third degree exploits
3rd degree Exploits are masterful acts of subterfuge and skill, and can be learned by Rogues of 9th level or higher. Each third degree Exploit you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #deviousexploit AND #thirddegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### fourth degree exploits
Exploits of the 4th degree can only be learned by Rogues of 13th level or higher, and each fourth degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #deviousexploit AND #fourthdegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### fifth degree exploits
Exploits of the 5th degree are devious feats that rival deeds of the most cunning tricksters and Archfey. These Exploits can only be learned by Rogues of 17th level or higher. Each fifth degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #deviousexploit AND #fifthdegree 
SORT file.name ASC
```
