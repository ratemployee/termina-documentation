Below are the Exploits available to Fighters. If an Exploit has a prerequisite, like a minimum Ability Score or level, you can learn it at the same time you meet the prerequisites.
### first degree exploits
Exploits of the 1st degree are minor techniques slightly more complicated than swinging a weapon. They can be learned by warriors with modest training and have no level prerequisite.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #martialexploit AND #firstdegree 
SORT file.name ASC
```

### second degree exploits
Exploits of the 2nd degree represent the peak of martial skill and ability achievable by warriors without dedicated training. These can be learned by any Fighter of 5th level or higher.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #martialexploit AND #seconddegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### third degree exploits
3rd degree Exploits are only mastered by elite warriors who dedicate their lives to training, and can be learned by Fighters of 9th level or higher. Each third degree Exploit you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.link, title) AS "exploit name"
FROM #martialexploit AND #thirddegree  
SORT file.name ASC
```

### fourth degree exploits
Exploits of the 4th degree can only be learned by Fighters of 13th level or higher, and each fourth degree Exploit that you know can only be used once per short or long rest.

SORT file.name ASC
```

### fifth degree exploits
