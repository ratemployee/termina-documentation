`PREREQUISITEs`
CHA 13

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to shout a one word command at one creature that can hear you within 30 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is compelled to obey your command to the best of its ability on its next turn unless its actions would be directly harmful to it.
