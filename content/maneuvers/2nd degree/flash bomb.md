`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with alchemist's supplies

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and use your alchemist's supplies to craft a Flash Bomb, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you can't regain this Exploit Die until you use the Flash Bomb.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to throw this Flash Bomb at a point it can see within 60 feet. It explodes on impact, and any creature within 20 feet of the impact that can see must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature with the _sunlight sensitivity_ trait makes its initial saving throw with disadvantage.

A blinded creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
