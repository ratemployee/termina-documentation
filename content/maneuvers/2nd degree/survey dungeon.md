`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX or INT 13

You can expend an Exploit Die to spend 10 minutes carefully examining a room you currently occupy. At the end of the 10 minutes, you gain knowledge about three of the following:

- One trap in the area. This includes any mechanical or natural effect that was intended to harm an intruder.
- One active spell in the area that was cast at a level equal to your Intelligence modifier or lower.
- One secret compartment, door, or passageway.

Once you use this Exploit to survey a room you must finish a long rest before you can use it in that location again.
