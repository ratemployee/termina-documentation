`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike the ground at your feet with a melee weapon. All creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier and fall prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. 

Terrain in this area that is loose earth or stone becomes difficult terrain until a creature uses its action to clear it.
