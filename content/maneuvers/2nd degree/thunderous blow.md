`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to empower your attack with immense force. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take additional damage equal to a roll of your Exploit Die and be knocked back in a straight line number of feet equal to 5 times your Strength modifier. A creature that is more than one size larger than you has advantage on its saving throw.
