`PREREQUISITEs`
CON or CHA 13

As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die and force one creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn and must use its action to move as far from you as possible without harming itself.
