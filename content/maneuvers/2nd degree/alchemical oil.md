`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with alchemist's supplies

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and use your alchemist's supplies to craft a vial of Alchemical Oil, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. Upon creation, you choose either acid, cold, fire, or lightning as the damage type for that vial of oil. You cannot regain the Exploit Die spent on this oil until you expend this Alchemical Oil.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to expend the vial and apply its contents to one weapon it is holding. For the next 10 minutes, that weapon deals the damage type chosen for that Alchemical Oil in place of its normal damage.

A creature can use an action to remove the Alchemical Oil.
