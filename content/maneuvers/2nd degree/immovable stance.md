`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or CON 13

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to enter an immovable stance that lasts until you move from the space. Each time a creature attempts to grapple, move you against your will, or move through your space while you are in this stance, it must first succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can instantly grapple it or knock it prone.
