`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to instantly make one additional weapon attack against that creature. On hit, you deal additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die. 

If you score a critical hit with the attack granted by this Exploit, you cannot use this Exploit again to make another attack.
