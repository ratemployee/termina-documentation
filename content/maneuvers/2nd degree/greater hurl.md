`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to touch one creature at least one size smaller than you and attempt to throw it. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be thrown at a space that you can see within 30 feet. A creature can choose to fail. 

If the creature lands in an unoccupied space it falls prone. But, if it hits another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength modifier. 

If a feature causes you to count as a size larger for your carrying capacity or the size of creatures you can grapple, you also count as one size larger for the creatures you can throw.
