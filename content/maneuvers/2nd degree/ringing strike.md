`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to send it reeling. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it must subtract 1d4 from all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws it makes for 1 minute.

A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
