When you hit a target with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to cripple one of its senses. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it takes additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die and is blinded, deafened, or cannot speak (your choice) until the start of your next turn.
