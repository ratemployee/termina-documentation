`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or DEX 13

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force each target within reach of a melee weapon you are wielding to make a Dexterity saving throw. Targets take damage equal to a roll of your Exploit Die + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.
