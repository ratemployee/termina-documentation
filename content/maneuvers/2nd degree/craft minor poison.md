`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with poisoner's kit

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and use your poisoner's kit to craft one vial of Minor Poison, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you cannot regain this Exploit Die until you expend this poison.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to expend the vial and apply it to one weapon or a piece of ammunition it is holding. On its next hit, the weapon deals poison damage in place of its normal damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it is poisoned for 1 minute.

The poisoned creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
