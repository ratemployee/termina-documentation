As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die and shout a challenge at a foe. One creature of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls it makes against targets other than you for 1 minute. 

The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This effect ends early if you attack a creature other than the target.
