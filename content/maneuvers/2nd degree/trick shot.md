`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX or INT 13

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to make a special ranged weapon attack with a weapon that has both the finesse and thrown properties.

This attack ignores the benefits of cover, so long as it can ricochet off one surface and hit a target in range. If this attack would normally have disadvantage, it does not, and on hit, it deals additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
