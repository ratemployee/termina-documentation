`PREREQUISITEs`
WIS 13

In place of an attack, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to touch a creature, attempting to knock it out. For each Exploit Die that you spent you roll three Exploit Dice, adding your Wisdom modifier to the total of all the dice. If the total meets or exceeds the creature's remaining hit points, it instantly falls asleep, and is unconscious for 10 minutes.

The creature instantly wakes up if it takes damage or another creature uses an action on its turn to shake or slap the sleeping creature awake.
