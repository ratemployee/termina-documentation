`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 13

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die to fire a volley of ammunition at a point you can see within normal range of your weapon. Creatures of your choice within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On a failure, they take piercing damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Dexterity modifier, and half as much on a success.

You must have enough ammunition to hit each target.
