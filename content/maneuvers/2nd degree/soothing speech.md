`PREREQUISITEs`
CHA 13

As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die and speak to all creatures that can hear and understand you within 20 feet, and force them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, creatures become indifferent toward creatures of your choice that they are currently hostile toward for 10 minutes.

This indifference ends if a creature takes damage, is forced to make a saving throw, or it witnesses an ally being harmed. When the effect ends, the creature becomes hostile again.
