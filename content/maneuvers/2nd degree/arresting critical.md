`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to critically disable its movement. For 1 minute, its speed is reduced to 0. 

The creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
