`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to rend its armor. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or it takes additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die and its Armor Class is reduced by 1 until the damage is repaired, or it finishes a long rest.
