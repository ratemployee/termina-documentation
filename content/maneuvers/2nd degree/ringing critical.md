`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 13

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to daze your target. For 1 minute, that creature must roll a d4 and subtract the result from any attack roll and saving throw it makes. 

The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
