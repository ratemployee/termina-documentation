`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 13

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike at a vulnerable area. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it takes additional damage equal to a roll of your Exploit Die, falls prone, and it cannot take reactions until the start of your next turn.
