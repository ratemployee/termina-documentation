`PREREQUISITEs`
CON or WIS 13

As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to temporarily heighten your senses. For 10 minutes you gain a bonus to any Wisdom (Insight) Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks you make equal to one roll of your Exploit Die, so long as the checks rely on your sense of sight or smell. 

You can also smell the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you, and identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease. 

Your senses cannot detect anything behind full cover.
