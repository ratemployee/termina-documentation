`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or CON 13

As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to form your allies into a defensive position. You and allied creatures within 10 feet that are wielding a weapon or shield gain the benefits of half cover, which also apply to ability checks and saving throws made to avoid being moved against your will.

The benefits of this Exploit instantly end if you leave your space, and they have no effect on incapacitated creatures.
