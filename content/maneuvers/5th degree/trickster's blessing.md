`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 19

When you take the Hide action, you can expend one Exploit Die to hide with inconceivable and supernatural skill. So long as there is a place to hide within 60 feet, you instantly appear in one such hidden location of your choice within 60 feet, and are automatically considered to be hidden from all spells and creatures, no matter what senses or magic they might have.
