`PREREQUISITEs`
INT 19

At the end of a long rest, you can expend one of your Exploit Dice to put an undisclosed contingency plan into place. Until you activate this Exploit again you cannot regain this Exploit Die. You can only have one contingency plan at a time.

As an action, you can reveal your previously undisclosed plan (which you make up at the time of its reveal) and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. You may add a skill the DM deems appropriate to your plan. On a success, your secret plans and preparations take effect perfectly as you described them.

The cost to execute your plan cannot exceed the equivalent of 5,000 gp, and the effects cannot exceed a 7th-level spell.

For example, you may reveal that you secretly purchased the perfect spell scroll last time you were in a town, or that you paid a mercenary band or airship to come to your rescue.
