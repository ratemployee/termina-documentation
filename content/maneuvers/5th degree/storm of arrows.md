`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 19

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to fire a volley of ammunition at a point you can see within the range of your weapon. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or they take piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + your Dexterity modifier. Any creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much piercing damage.

You must have enough ammunition to hit each target.
