`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with poisoner's kit

As an action, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and use a poisoner's kit to craft a vial of Masterwork Poison, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you can't regain the Exploit Dice you spent in its creation until you expend this poison.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to expend the vial and apply it to one weapon or piece of ammunition it is holding. On its next hit, it deals additional necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until a spell of 5th-level or higher is used to neutralize the poison (such asÂ [RESTORATION](app://obsidian.md/restoration)).

If the creature fails by 5 or more, it is incapacitated, and it cannot move or speak until it is cured of this poison.
