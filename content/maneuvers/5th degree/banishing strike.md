`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 19

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with legendary power, dealing bonus force damage equal to four rolls of your Exploit Die. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or be shunted to a harmless demiplane where it is incapacitated. At the start of your next turn it reappears in the unoccupied space nearest to the last space it occupied when you hit it with this attack.
