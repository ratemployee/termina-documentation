`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or DEX 19

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike with legendary force, dealing additional damage equal to four rolls of your Exploit Die.

If the damage of this Exploit reduces the target's remaining hit points to 50 or fewer, you cut off one of the its heads. If the creature cannot survive without the lost head, it is killed.

Creatures can use a Legendary Resistance to avoid being beheaded. Any creatures that don't have or don't need a head are immune to this Exploit's effects, but still take the damage.
