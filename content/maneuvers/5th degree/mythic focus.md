As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to enter a legendary state of focus which you must concentrate on as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 1 minute, or until you lose concentration, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the effects of this Exploit end, they are lost.
- You have advantage on any weapon attacks you make.
- Once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack, you deal bonus damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
- You gain a bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action.

When the effect ends, you canâ€™t move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you.

This Exploit doesn't stack with [[arcane transformation]].
