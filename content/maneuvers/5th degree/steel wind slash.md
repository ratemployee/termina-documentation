`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or DEX 19

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and flourish a melee weapon then vanish.

Choose up to five targets that you can see within 30 feet and make one melee weapon attack against each one.

On a hit, each target takes damage of your weapon's type equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + either your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

You then appear in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets of this Exploit.
