`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 19

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to strike the ground with mythic power. A shockwave of thunderous force erupts from you, forcing all creatures within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent + your Strength modifier and are knocked prone, and on a success, they take half as much damage and don't fall prone. Objects in this area take maximum damage. 

The area becomes difficult terrain, and a creature can use its action to clear one 5-foot square of this difficult terrain.
