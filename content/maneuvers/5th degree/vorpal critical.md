`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 19

When you score a critical hit with a melee attack on a creature, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike with brutal legendary force and deal additional damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die. 

If the damage of this Exploit reduces the target's remaining hit points to 50 or fewer, you instantly cut off one of the its heads. If it can't survive without that head, it is killed. 

Creatures can use Legendary Resistance to avoid being beheaded. Any creatures that don't have or don't need a head are immune to this Exploit's effects, but still take the additional damage on hit.
