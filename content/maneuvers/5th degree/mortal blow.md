When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with supernatural accuracy at its most vulnerable point. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it is considered vulnerable to the damage of this attack. If you had advantage on your attack roll, it makes this Constitution save with disadvantage.

Regardless if the creature succeeds or fails on this saving throw, it takes additional damage of your weapon's type equal to four rolls of your Exploit Die. Finally, if the damage of this attack reduces the creature to 50 hit points or fewer, it falls prone and is stunned until the beginning of its next turn. A creature can use a Legendary Resistance to avoid this effect.
