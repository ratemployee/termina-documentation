`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 11

While you are wielding a finesse or versatile weapon, and a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add it to your Armor Class against that attack. Should this cause the attack to miss, you can make one melee weapon attack against your attacker as part of the same reaction.
