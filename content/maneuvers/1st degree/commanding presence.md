`PREREQUISITEs`
STR or CHA 11

Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check you can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your ability check. You can do so after you roll the d20, but before you know if you succeed. 

Also, whenever you would make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you can make a Strength (Intimidation) check instead.
