`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with alchemist's supplies

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and use your alchemist's supplies to craft a Smoke Bomb, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you can't regain this Exploit Die until you use the Smoke Bomb

A creature can take the Use an Object action to throw this Smoke Bomb at a point it can see within 60 feet. It explodes on impact, creating a 20-foot-radius sphere of smoke, which spreads around corners, centered on the impact. The smoke heavily obscures the area and lasts for 10 minutes. It can be dispersed by a moderate wind of at least 10 miles per hour.
