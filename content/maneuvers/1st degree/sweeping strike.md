When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die and falls prone. A creature more than one size larger than you has advantage on its saving throw.
