`PREREQUISITEs`
INT 11

Whenever you would normally make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can choose to use your Intelligence in place of Charisma for that ability check.

Also, whenever you make an Intelligence (Deception) or Intelligence (Persuasion) check you can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your check. You can do so after you roll the d20, but before you know if you succeed.
