`PREREQUISITEs`
WIS 11

When your trained mount makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, or you make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control it, you can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your ability check. You can do so after you roll the d20, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
