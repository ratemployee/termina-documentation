`PREREQUISITEs`
CHA 11

If you are in a settlement, you can make Charisma (History) and Charisma (Investigation) checks instead of the normal Intelligence (History) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks.

Also, when you make a Charisma (History) or a Charisma (Investigation) check, you can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your ability check. You can do so after you roll the d20, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
