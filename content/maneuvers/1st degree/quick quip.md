`PREREQUISITEs`
INT or CHA 11

While speaking, you can expend an Exploit Die to tell a short joke, quip, or another humorous anecdote. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet that can both hear and understand you forget everything you said during the 10 seconds preceding this Exploit, and instead only remember your quip.

Creatures that are immune to being charmed are immune to this Exploit. Once you use this Exploit on a creature, it is immune to the effects of this Exploit for the next 24 hours.
