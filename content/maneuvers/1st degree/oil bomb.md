`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with alchemist's supplies

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and use your alchemists supplies to craft an Oil Bomb, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you cannot regain this Exploit Die until you use the Oil Bomb.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to throw this Oil Bomb at a point it can see within 60 feet. It explodes on impact, covering a 10-foot square centered on that point with alchemical oil, turning it into difficult terrain. Any creatures in that area upon impact, and any creature that enters the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

The Oil retains its potency on the ground for 1 minute.
