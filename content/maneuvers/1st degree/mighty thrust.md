`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 11

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to force a target you touch to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is knocked back in a line number of feet equal to 5 times your Strength modifier. Targets that are more than one size larger than you have advantage on this saving throw.
