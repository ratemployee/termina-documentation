`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 11

When you move at least 20 feet toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and attempt to trample the creature. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die and is knocked prone.
