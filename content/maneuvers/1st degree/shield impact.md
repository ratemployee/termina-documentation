`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 11

When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use a reaction to expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus), roll those dice, and reduce the damage of that attack by an amount equal to the total you rolled + your Strength modifier. You must be wielding a shield to use this Exploit.
