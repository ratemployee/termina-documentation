`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 11

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to knock the air from your target's lungs. For 1 minute, that creature can speak only falteringly and its speed is halved. 

The creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
