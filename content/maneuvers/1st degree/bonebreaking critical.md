`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 11

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to cripple the target. For 1 minute, that creature deals only half damage with any attacks it makes that use its Strength.

The creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
