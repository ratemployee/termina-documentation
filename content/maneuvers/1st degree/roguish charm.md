`PREREQUISITEs`
CHA 11

As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die and force a creature  within 10 feet that can hear and understand you to make a Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failure, it is charmed by you for 1 hour, and regards you as a friendly acquaintance for the duration. Though, it will not risk its life for you. 

This effect immediately ends if you or your companions do anything harmful to the creature, and when the effect ends this way, the target realizes that it was deceived by you.

Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw against this Exploit it is immune to this Exploit for the next 24 hours.
