When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die, and it drops one item of your choice that it is currently holding on the ground in the space it is occupying.
