`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with tinker's tools or thieves' tools

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and use either tinker's or thieves' tools to make adjustments to one trap or lock that you can touch. The DC of that trap or lock changes to equal your Exploit save DC, or increases by 5 (your choice).

To use this Exploit, the trap or lock must be deactivated or unlocked, and you must have access to its inner mechanisms. You cannot use this Exploit to modify a trap or lock that can't be reset, or one that has been destroyed beyond repair.
