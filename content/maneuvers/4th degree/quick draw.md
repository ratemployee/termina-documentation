`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 17

As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die and enter into a heightened state of focus which you must concentrate on as if concentrating on a spell. For the next minute, or until you lose concentration, you can use a bonus action, including the bonus action you used to use this Exploit to make two ranged weapon attacks so long as you have ammunition.

This Exploit's effects don't stack with the [[swift quiver]] spell.
