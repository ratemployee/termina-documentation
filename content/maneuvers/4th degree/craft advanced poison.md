`PREREQUISITEs`
Proficiency with poisoner's kit

As an action, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and use a poisoner's kit to craft a vial of Advanced Poison, which retains its potency until the end of your next long rest. However, you can't regain the Exploit Dice you spent in its creation until you expend this poison.

A creature can take the Use an Object action to expend the vial and apply it to one weapon or piece of ammunition it is holding. On its next hit, it deals additional acid damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die for each Exploit Die you spent, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks for 1 hour. If it fails by 5 or more, it is blinded for the duration.

As an action, the creature can repeat this saving throw. On a successful save, the effects end, but on a failed save, it takes additional acid damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
