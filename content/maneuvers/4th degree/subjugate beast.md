#maneuver #fourthdegree #primalexploit 

As an action, you can expend one Exploit Die and attempt to intimidate one beast that can see or hear you within 30 feet, bending it to your will. The beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be considered charmed by you for 1 minute. 

While it is charmed, you can use a bonus action to issue it a command, which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it doesnâ€™t receive direction from you, it defends itself to the best of its ability. 

Each time the beast takes damage, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effects of this Exploit on a success.
