`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 17

When you score a critical hit on a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to shatter its focus. If it was concentrating on a spell or effect, it automatically loses concentration, and for 1 minute, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, and any saving throws it makes to maintain concentration. 

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
