`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 17

In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike a creation of magical force, such as a [[prismatic wall]], [[resilient sphere]], or [[forcecage]] with a melee weapon you are wielding. Any magical creations created with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower are instantly destroyed by your strike. 

If the magical creation was created with a spell of 4th-level or higher, make a Strength check. The DC equals 10 + the level of the spell slot used to create it. On a successful check, the magical creation is instantly destroyed by your strike.
