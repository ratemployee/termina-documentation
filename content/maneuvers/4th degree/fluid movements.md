DEX 17

As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to enter a heightened state of movement which you must concentrate on as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 1 minute, or until you lose concentration, you gain the following benefits:
- Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain.
- You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain the benefits of both the Dash and Disengage action.
- Spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be paralyzed or restrained.
- You can spend 5 feet of movement to instantly escape from nonmagical restraints like manacles or a grapple.
- Swimming or being underwater imposes no penalties on your movements or your attack rolls.
