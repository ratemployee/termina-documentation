`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 17

As a bonus action you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) to enhance your strength to mythic levels, though you must concentrate on this Exploit's effect as if you were concentrating on a spell. For 10 minutes, or until you lose concentration, the amount of weight you can push, drag, pull, or lift is multiplied by the amount in the table below:

| **Exploit Dice** |   **Total Weight**   |
| :--------------: | :------------------: |
| Without Exploit  | 30 x Strength score  |
|        1         | 50 x Strength score  |
|        2         | 100 x Strength score |
|        3         | 150 x Strength score |
|        4         | 200 x Strength score |
|        5         | 250 x Strength score |
|        6         | 300 x Strength score |
For each size category you are above Medium, the amount of weight you can move as part of this Exploit is doubled. 

For example, a Medium-sized Barbarian with 20 Strength could expend 3 Exploit Dice to use this Exploit, multiplying their 20 Strength by 150, to lift up to 3,000 pounds. If they were Large, they would double this weight to 6,000 pounds. 

When this Exploit ends you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a number of levels of exhaustion equal to the number of Exploit Dice you spent.
