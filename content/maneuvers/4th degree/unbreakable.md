`PREREQUISITEs`
CON 17

When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, even if that damage would kill you outright, you can spend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and fall to 1 hit point. For each Exploit Die you spent, you roll three Exploit Dice, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.
