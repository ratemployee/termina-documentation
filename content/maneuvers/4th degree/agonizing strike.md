`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 17

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die to strike with precision to inflict pain instead of dealing damage. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the following effects for 1 minute:

- Any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet.
- It has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- It has disadvantage on all saving throws other than Constitution saving throws.
- If it attempts to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Exploit save DC, or the casting fails and the spell slot is wasted.

It can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this crippling pain on a successful save.
