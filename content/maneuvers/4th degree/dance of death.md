`PREREQUISITEs`
DEX 17

As an action on your turn, you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus) and instantly strike with a melee weapon you are holding at a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to 1 + the number of dice expended, forcing them to make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take damage of your weapon's type equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die + your Dexterity modifier on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful save.

For each of the creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this Exploit, you can force another creature of your choice within range of this Exploit to make the Dexterity saving throw.

Once the Exploit ends, you appear in an unoccupied space of your choice next to one of the targets of this Exploit.
