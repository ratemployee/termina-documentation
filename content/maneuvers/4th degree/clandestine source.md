`PREREQUISITEs`
INT or CHA 17

While in a settlement of sufficient size, you can expend one Exploit Die and spend 1 hour using the Thieves' Cant found throughout the settlement to track down a significant figure of the criminal underworld to ask questions of.

Should the DM decide that such a figure exists within the settlement, you must approach them alone, and must make a DC 15 Intelligence or Charisma saving throw (your choice) to convince them to grant you an audience. On a failed save, you are reduced to 0 hit points, and your body is left unconscious in an alleyway or gutter somewhere in that settlement.

On a successful save, you have 2 minutes to ask the figure up to five questions. The figure answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if they do not know the answer). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the figure might instead offer a short phrase as an answer to that question.

Once you use this Exploit in a settlement (successfully or unsuccessfully), you cannot use it there again for 7 full days.
