`PREREQUISITEs`
STR 17

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to strike with near-supernatural power, dealing additional damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or for the next minute it has disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls and it cannot take reactions. 

The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending these effects on a success.
