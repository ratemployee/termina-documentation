The Dungeon23 challenge is a 365-day endeavour proposed by Sean McCoy in [this blog post](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23). It consists of creating a Megadungeon, one room at a time. The goal of the challenge is to create:
- 365 rooms
- 12 dungeon levels (one for each month)
- 1 megadungeon at the end of the year

This workflow adds templates and macros for use during the Dungeon23 challenge, to automate some of the note creation part. It consists of:
- [[dungeon23 room]] template
- [[Dungeon23 Megadungeon]] list, where each new room will automatically be dated and added

## Plugins used

- QuickAdd
- Templater

## Instructions

1. Either use the hotkey `CTRL+D` or open up the Command Pane (`CMD/CTRL+P`) and select `QuickAdd: Macro - Create new dungeon23 room`.
2. Enter the title of your room and hit Enter or click OK.
3. After the bullet, start typing the description of your room. Be brief.
4. (optional) In the Image section, add a reference image or a quick map of your room.
