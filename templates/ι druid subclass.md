Your link with your Druidic Circle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the [[druid spell list]], the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
